            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>
               </hi> Year and more is pas't, ſince it pleaſed Doctor Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Stillingfleet to move ſome difficulties about Two main points in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, and to Show his Skill in Both. The one ſpeculative relates to the Churches Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the Reſolution of Faith. The other, in the Second Part, touch'd upon à plain Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, the Miraculous Tranſlation of the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> now ſtands, honoured by à frequent Concourſe of People from all Parts of Europe. In my laſt little Treatiſe, I endeavovred to Satisfy the Dr in the Speculative Part, and, as I think, cleared all Difficulties objected againſt that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Tranſlation, And did this to pleaſe the Dr, though hitherto He never gave mee thanks for my pains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much leſs returned any Word of Anſwer. Having ended that short Treatiſe, I promiſed à Satisfactory Reply to the reſt of Dr Stillingfleet's many Cavils careleſly thrown out
<pb facs="tcp:96808:3"/> at Miracles wrought in the Roman Catholick Church; And here comply with my Promiſe, where <hi>I</hi> show that never man had worſer luck in any Engagement than the Dr in this undertaken <hi>Enquiry.</hi> His chiefeſt Aime was, as every one ſee's, ſo to manage matters as not only to cast à blemish upon ſome latter Miracles, but to diſgrace all wrought in the Church, though in the Purſuit, he shrinks ſo far as never to meddle with the true State of the Queſtion propoſed, or rationally to oppoſe one clear and approved Miracle, as you shall ſee hereafter.</p>
            <p>The Method held by me in this Treatiſe is as followes. I firſt Evince the Truth of our Saviours Miracles by Arguments drawn from rational Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, For we may (I hope) ſuppoſe this to bee à ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Princiciple, That ſome Books of Hiſtory univerſally received are for the Subſtance true, and not wholly forged. Thus much only gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I Diſcourſe, and require no more. 2. I prove upon the ſame rational Grounds hereafter alledged, true Miracles to have been wrought in the Roman Catholick Church, and produce many moſt clear ones ſeen by <hi>Ey-witneſſes,</hi> whereof no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ever yet doubted. 3. I waite on the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> in his other Pilgrimâges made to <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> and S. <hi>Maximin's</hi> in France, and upon that occaſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Pope <hi>Evariſtus</hi> his VVritings. 4. I produce the Teſtimonies of Ancient Fathers ſo manifeſt and pregnant for the Churches Miracles, that no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Writer of this Age ever yet did, or can ſpeak vvith greater Energy. 5. I examin ſuch Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (and herein have taken ſome pains) as the
<pb facs="tcp:96808:3"/> Dr thinks, make most againſt the vvorking of new Miracles ſince the Apostles Dayes. And I did more vvillingly engage in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular upon the Dr's ovvn Provocation. <hi>I deſire them,</hi> ſaith he, in his Epistle Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory, <hi>not to ſpare me in this preſent ſubject of Miracles, wherein I profeſs to relye on their own Writers. If they show me any wilful miſtakes therein, I will endeavour to give them publick ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> Stand to your vvord M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dr, And if I do not shovv à vvhole large Liſt of many groſs miſtakes driven on by Malice Ignorance, or both, I'le crave your Pardon, and vvillingly ovvn my Errour before the vvhole vvorld. Reader, in this Conteſt, there can be no long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, the comparing Authorities (after you have opened the Dr's Book and mine), vvill clear all, and afford Great Store of Miſtakes.</p>
            <p>Now Seing the Dr relies on our ovvn Writers, and hopes he err's not, my Demand is, In vvhat doth he rely on them for? Has be any Catholick Author that oppoſes approved Miracles? So it is, ſaith the Dr. <hi>The Teſtimony of thoſe who</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr p. 440.</note> 
               <hi>deliver Miracles hath been contradicted by men of greater Authority than themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve.</hi> I Say contrary. The Propoſition is manifeſtly untrue, Such men of greater Authority vvere ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet heard of (nor can one be named) as is made out in this Treatiſe, vvhere you vvill ſe, that the Dr fraudulently introduces Authors contrary to Miracles, vvho vvith all might and main
<pb facs="tcp:96808:4"/> in expreſs Terms allow them. It is true, Dr Iohn Launoy (one of little credit as appear's afterwards) quibbles at many matters of Fact reputed Miraculous, yet never hitherto durſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Church to have had true Miracles wrought in it. What the Dr Quotes from <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> relating to à ſuſpenſion of all latter Miracles, is more than moſt profoundly ſimple, as you may read C. 10. n. 16. Now if the Dr in Lieu of relying on true Miracles, lean upon this fallacious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, That there have been Many forged by ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, and will liſt theſe among the Churches true Signs, he is unworthy to be dealt with, and doth not only Miſtake, but moſt groſly Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niat's.</p>
            <p>Some (who they are I know not) thought the Dr not to deal fairly in his Quoting Authors, whereof be ſeem's very ſenſible in his Preface, and deem's it ſo groundleſſe à Calumny, yea ſo void of Proof, that he deſires no better Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of à bafled Cauſe, than ſuch impertinent Clamours. Soon after followes à Brag of à lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Size. <hi>Do they indeed think me à man ſo void of Common ſence, as to expoſe my ſelfe to the contempt of every one, that will take pains to compare my Citations? Have I Books only in my own keeping? Or are they ſo rare, that they cannot get à ſight of them? How then come they to know them falſe cited?</hi> Reader, I have be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> me, Thanks be to God, the Books the Dr re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb facs="tcp:96808:4"/> me to, I have compared with my own eyes his Citations, and after that pains taken cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know, that the Dr has groſly erred, or to uſe his own words, <hi>expoſed himſelfe to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Contempt.</hi> For Proof hereof I muſt ſpeak plainly (though little to the Dr's comfort) and do make my Aſſertion good in the enſuing Treatiſe. <hi>Not one only, but all the Dr's Citations produced againſt the Churches approved Miracles, are either very fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely Quoted; Or peevishly perverted to à ſiniſter Sence; or finally wholly imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the matter here debated.</hi> Falſe Citations are many, perverted ones more, and the impertinent almoſt numberleſs. To prove every part of my Aſſertion in this place, were to bring back one great Piece of this whole Treatiſe into the narrow compaſs of à short Preface. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever à few hints at ſome cannot take up much roome. It is falſe (though the Dr aſſert's it) That Gerſon Saies in à certain Epiſtle, <hi>That now the working of Miracles is wholly taken away, and none but falſe Chriſtians</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr p. 688.</note> 
               <hi>pretend to it.</hi> It is ſalſe, That according to S. Gregory, whatever Miracles we Suppoſe to remain in the Church, we do not look on <hi>them, as wrought for the confirmation of any neceſſary Part of Chriſtian Faith. All is</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr p. 613.</note> 
               <hi>Contrary.</hi> The Saint as you may read C. 3. produces à stupendious Miracle done upon à Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man incredulous Matrone to confirme the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of <hi>the Real Preſence.</hi> It is falſe, That
<pb facs="tcp:96808:5"/> 
               <hi>Didacus Stella</hi> (vvho expreſly ovvn's great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles) ſaith, That the Povver of Miracles is cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. It is falſe, <hi>That according to Suares,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr p. 686.</note> ſuch Miracles as vvere vvrought upon Father Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrilli, and the young Man of Zaragoza, vvere only done for the Benefit of thoſe vvho received them, and not to confirm the Churches Infallible Doctrin. It is falſe, That Maldonate confeſſes, That ſince Chriſtian Religion has been confirmed<note place="margin">Dr p. 687.</note> by Miracles in the Churches beginning, there is no neceſſity of Miracles for that End. It is falſe That either Ioſephus Acoſta, or S. Hippolitus teach, That Antichrist shall do far greater Miracles,<note place="margin">Dr p. 688,</note> than the Cures vvrought upon F. Marcellus, or on the reſtored Leg at Zaragoza. It is falſe, That the bleeding vvounds of S. Francis imprinted on his<note place="margin">Dr p. 504.</note> ſide, hands, and feet, vvere ſo concealed, That no, man could ever fully diſcern them in his life time, only Fryer Ruffin once thought he eſpied the vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und in his ſide. Thus much of falſe Citations for an Eſſay only, the Treatiſe vvill afford many more.</p>
            <p>Should I now trace the Dr though his groſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Quotations quite contrary to the meaning of Authors, the work would be long. One or Two only at preſent shall ſuffice, The remainder you have afterwards. And firſt, what man in his Wits would ever have cited S. Augustine as one that oppoſes latter Miracles, when he could not but know, that no Catholick Author in this Age ſaid more in their Defence, as appear's by his large<note place="margin">Dr P. 582.</note> proſecuting this Subject in his 22. Book de Civit. C. 8, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> yet forſooth, Miracles are no Proof of
<pb facs="tcp:96808:5"/> the true Church (though the Saint plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, Miracles held him in the Church) Nor in rigour to be called Miracles, <hi>But ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Things among them in their time:</hi> That is, the Dr would have us believe,<note place="margin">Dr p. 584.</note> 
               <hi>the reſtoring Sight to the blind, raiſing the dead to life, curing incurable Maladies</hi> (for of theſe S. Auguſtine expreſly ſpeak's) are not like the Apoſtolical Miracles, but of an Inferiour rank, <hi>Extraordinary things, forſooth,</hi> and no more. Is nor this à plain Corruption of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſignificant words and meaning?</p>
            <p>None hitherto in any Age maintained the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Miracles with greater Zeal than <hi>S. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom, Abbulenſis,</hi> and our <hi>learned Bishop Fisher,</hi> as is amply proved in this Treatiſe, yet the Dr by the help of an open Cheat depraves their meaning, and will needs perſwade us that they teach, Miracles to have ceaſed in the Church. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cheat is thus. As S. Chryſoſtom and the other Authors now cited, grant à ſpecial Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Twelve Apoſtles, in Writing Canonical Scripture by Divine Inſpiration, ſo alſo (and moſt truly) they yeild them à power of working all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of admirable Miracles, particularly in laying hands on <hi>the lately Baptized, and viſibly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Holy Ghoſt</hi> (the like Priviledge the Primitive Chriſtians participated in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure). Theſe ſingular Graces ſay Authors an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the <hi>Twelve,</hi> were never entailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any like ſet number of men, though Prelates and Paſtors in the Church?, and therefore ceaſed. VVhence the Dr would conclude,
<pb facs="tcp:96808:6"/> That all other Miracles whatever, <hi>as rayſing the Dead, and curing deſperate Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi> had à ſtop in after Ages, and ceaſed alſo. Which is to tell us, becauſe God honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not the Churches Prelates with the very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, or ſo great à Prerogative as he did the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, All Miracles Seem ſo ſuſpended, that no more are wrought, A foul Cheat (worſe than à Mistake) quite contrary to the Quoted Authors words and Doctrin. See C. IX. from n. 11. and C. XI. from n. 7. The impertinent Citations, or ſuch as look from the matter now diſputed, are innumerable. All thoſe whether true or falſe produced againſt forged Miracles, <hi>known as forged,</hi> no more concern the preſent Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, than the Dr's pretty Verſe cited out of Virgil. <hi>Speluncam Dido</hi> &amp;c. His other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies Quoted from <hi>Paulus Zaccheus, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus Scacchus,</hi> and <hi>Contelorius,</hi> are meer inſignificant Cyphers, take up roome, and that's all the good they do. Theſe and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder you will have laid forth in the Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. It is therefore needleſs to inſist on more at preſent.</p>
            <p>Another grand Miſtake or groſs Errour, you meet with in the Dr, where He ſayes. <hi>The greateſt number of Miracles in the Roman Church have been believed upon the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of Fables, and uncertain Reports;</hi> And this hee offer's to show <hi>upon ſtrict Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi> I Anſwer firſt. VVere all Fables which the Dr deem's ſo, the Propoſition confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
<pb facs="tcp:96808:6"/> it ſelfe, For Miracles upheld by Fables, are no Church Miracles, But I boldly aſſert, that Mr Dr through his whole Book has not proved ſo much as one received Church-Miracle, (much leſs the greater number) to have had their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen from Fables, or ever gained repute in the world upon uncertain Reports, nor shall he he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reafter in any low degree make his Aſſertion Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. His ſtrict Examination fall's firſt upon the Miraculous Tranſlation of <hi>the Houſe of Loreto</hi> from <hi>Nazareth,</hi> thought by him fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, whereof I ſpake largely in my laſt Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. Here I require that all diligently obſerve whither this <hi>rigid Examination</hi> is brought at laſt? Reader, it comes to two or three Idle Queſtions attended with ſome Saucy Schoffs, and there is all. VVhat ſaith the Dr (after he had recounted <hi>Teremanus his Table</hi> concerning the Tranſlation) <hi>Is not this à pleaſant Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be matched in point of Credibility with the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les?</hi> Again, <hi>what do theſe men think in their hearts, that dare avouch ſuch ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Fictions as theſe?</hi> Such ſimple De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Reader, which have neither <hi>weight, nor Bottom,</hi> nor <hi>Principle</hi> to ſtand on, ſet forth with Bobs and Ieers give force to our Dr's Swinging proofs, finish his fearful rigid Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and muſt be thought powerful enough to throw down the Houſe of <hi>Loreto.</hi> The like ſtrain He hold's through his whole Book. It ſeem's by the Dr, that our Venerable Bede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
<pb facs="tcp:96808:7"/> ſome ſtrange Miracles wrought upon <hi>S. Cuthbert.</hi> One is (to be brief (that Angels appearing to the Saint on horſeback when he was young, preſcribed à Poulteſs to cure his Sore Knee. Another is of his Seeing à Troop of Angels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the Soul of <hi>S. Aidan</hi> into Heaven. The <hi>Dr to perfect his ſtrict Examination;</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Asks (there's all) <hi>what muſt we think of theſe Angels appearing, And that he is of à good eaſy Faith that can believe them?</hi> He might as wiſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> have demanded, what shall we think of thoſe Viſions of Armies fighting in the Air ouer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hieruſalem fourty Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes together. Machabees. 2, C. 5? VVhat must we think of the Angel Raphael, that preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed (No Poulteſs but) the gall of à Fish for the Cure of <hi>old Tobias</hi> his Eyes. Tobit. 11. Such VVonders recounted in History never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted, are wholly as ſtrange as what Bede VVrites, though moſt lamely caſt off by the Dr and refuted by asking. <hi>What shall we think of them?</hi> Much leſs can ſuch trifling Queſtions, imply any thing like à strict Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. <hi>A ſtrict Examination,</hi> Reader ponder's firſt, what Strength the Authors have which are produced for à <hi>Theſis,</hi> The Dr weigh's none, nor alledges any, that calls the Tranſlation of that Houſe, or theſe other VVonders now recorded, <hi>Fabulous.</hi> It ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. 2. That whoever denies an Aſſertion plainly proved (and what can be more plain
<pb facs="tcp:96808:7"/> than my alledged proofs for the Tranſlation) Is obliged to give meaſure for meaſure, and either show his Adverſaries Teſtimonies unconcluding, or infringe their force by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me contrary Reaſon or Authority. The Dr Strangely forgetful of this Duty, doth neither, But as far as Huffs and flurts hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him on, layes about him luſtily. You have no more: However ſuch faint empty ſtuff muſt paſſe for <hi>à ſtrict and rigid Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> May this Procedure hold, à Iew or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then needs only to Huffe and tell us. VVe Chriſtians are all ridiculous in believing à Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed man to be our Redeemer, wherunto if he give an Overplus of Ieers, eaſily caſt out of an Infidels mouth, he proves every whit as much <hi>againſt Chriſt,</hi> as our Dr doth against the Houſe of Loreto. There is yet more of this ill Nicknam'd ſtrict Examination in the Dr. Reflect à little. I Quoted Reas: and Relig. <hi>C. 8.</hi> n. 5. as grave and learned Fathers as ever wrote, <hi>S, Irenaeus, S. Baſil, S. Hierome, S. Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſo clear aend expreſs for Miracles, that no Teſtimonies can be plainer. It ſeem's the Dr durst not jerk theſe great Authors vvith his uſual Taunts and Scoffs, but betakes himſelfe to another Subterfuge (men vvho live by shifting can do no better), I'll tell you what it is. Very vviſely he vvaves all, ſlip's by theſe Authorities, and though provoked to reply, return's not one vvord of Anſvver to any.
<pb facs="tcp:96808:8"/> May not this think ye paſs alſo for another Stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous proof of his <hi>Strict and careful Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two things may be conſidered in the Dr's wild <hi>Enquiry.</hi> The one <hi>what he hold's</hi> of ſubstance in it. The other relates to his pretty Mode and odd way in writing. To the Firſt, I ſay in à word (plain Dealing is beſt) and more amply prove it in this Treatiſe. <hi>There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear's nothing like Subſtance through his whole Enquiry.</hi> And firſt, if the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> shift's off all I required Satisfaction in, or rather, if he wholly wave what the world look's on as moſt Material in our preſent Controverſy, He is far from meddling vvith that, vvhich deſerves the name of Substance: But, this is Evidently ſo. Fray Reader, reflect à little. My deſire vvas, and is ſtill, (This all men look on as Subſtantial) that the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> vvould upon ſolid Principles Shovv but ſo much as one <hi>approved Miracle,</hi> forged, <hi>falſe,</hi> or <hi>fabulous:</hi> In Lieu of doing this, Mountebank like, he ſtep's upon the Stage, and vvould beguile us vvith à varnish of meer pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vvares, Idle Stories I mean, concerning Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles feigned by ungodly People, altogether as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent as if he had told us ſo many Fables out of Aeſop: For no more can forged Miracles diſparage God's true Wonders, than Counterfeit Scripture the Verities revealed in the Goſpel. Again (And here once more vve find à vvant of Subſtance) VVho vvould not have expected from this <hi>Man of Words</hi> after ſo many brisk Attempts, and
<pb facs="tcp:96808:8"/> flurts at Miracles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some clear Testimonies taken from the Ancient Church, from Ancient Records, from Tradition, Councils, Doctors, and Divins? But herein he is as mute as à Fish, and neither doth nor can attaque us this vvay. You have heard hovv the ancient Fathers and Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors renovvned upon the account of their Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Virtue, plead in Defence of Miracles, And all the right the Dr doth ſuch men, is not <hi>to believe them,</hi> Yet requires, that vve cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit his <hi>Philoſtorgius,</hi> his <hi>Hazenmiller</hi> and his falſe <hi>Daniel de Dieu,</hi> Vile Outcaſts and deteſtable Heretiques. Are vve not thus think ye Subſtantially Match't vvith Authorities? I produce Miracles Seen and atteſted upon Oath, vvrought by Saints and great Servants of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, And He to be even vvith me, makes à florish vvith the golden Thigh of <hi>Pythagoras, and Aeſculapius</hi> his cure done upon à dead vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Both falſe and fabulous,</hi> or at most vvorks of Necromancy as is proved in the Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. I all along inſiſt upon ſuch Miracles as have been knovvn and ovvned by the Very beſt of Chriſtians And he to retaliate (like one that had Vovved never to meddle vvith vvhat is Subſtantial) trif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les avvay time, in telling long Tales of the Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe of the <hi>Annunciada</hi> at Lisboe, and of one <hi>Fulco</hi> cryed up for à vvorker of VVonders, vvho, as the Dr vvill have it, proved an Impoſtor. I bring to light Miracles ſo clear and illuſtrious that none upon the Sight of <hi>their Evidence,</hi> ever yet could (though Criticks, vviſe, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:96808:9"/> call into doubt, And this Dr to Eclipſe their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, fob's me off vvith ſuch as are either dubious, or at moſt but in à mean Degree probable. Moſt fitly did S. Augustine Writing againſt <hi>Fauſtus</hi> lib. 5. C. Vltimo, once blame this unjuſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in his Adverſary. <hi>Veſtrum oculum malevolus error,</hi> Saith the Saint. Thy Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish and perverſe Errour dravves thy Eye, <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> to <hi>regard nothing but chaffe in our ſtanding Corne, whereas had'ſt thou look't about thee, thou might'ſt have fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und wheat, both pure and precious.</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Miracles only doubtful (much more forged ones) paſſe for Chaffe, the Church relies not on them, yet vvith ſuch Deceiptful Baites the Dr <hi>like Fauſtus,</hi> vvould fain vvhedle us into à mean conceipt of God's certain great VVonders, VVhereas the Contrary is evident, for falſe and forged Miracles vvhen diſcovered (as the moſt have been) are ſo far from fouling the Glory of God's true Wonders, that they confirme their Truth and make them more Illuſtrious; Had the Inquiſitors or Prelates of the Church (think yee) vvho left no ſtone unturned to find out ſuch Forgeries, and diſcovered many, upon that Sight à leſs Eſteem of God's Certain Miracles, that paſſ't the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Tribunal with all poſſible Applauſe? No. All thereupon extolled the Churches zeal and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy, having Long ſince learned from S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, That as Evil has its Good, and gives à Grace to Vertue, Errour add's Beauty to Truth, So theſe feigned Signs ſet forth the Glory of true
<pb facs="tcp:96808:9"/> Miracles. The Dr therefore get's nothing by his long liſt of forged VVonders.</p>
            <p>Reader, you will find hereafter the Dr's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in this Controverſy, drawn from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as lame and bare as his Inſtances and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities. VVhence I conclude, that if he bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom his Diſcourſe upon the fore-mentioned Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, And theſe fail or yeild him no ſupport, I rightly inſinuated above, and here again Say it more plainly, That his whole Book is nothing but à Rapſody, or à Work too unadviſedly ſet forth, in real Truth not worth Notice, or Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. Howeuer, becauſe once engaged. I haue undertaken à Confutation, not ill thought of by good Divines, Though the Dr, moſt likely, will not allow me ſo favourable à Cenſure.</p>
            <p>The Dr's way or mode in writing, whilſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance failes, cannot but be worthleſs, unſavory, and diſtaſtful. Peruſe him, Reader, page after page you will find the man all along in à peevish Humour, when you ſee his Book brim full of tare biting <hi>Ironies, Drolleries, Comical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, impertinent Demands, Idle Stories</hi> &amp;c. As if the diſgorging à little Gall, were enough to bring into Contempt the Cleareſt Miracles God ever wrought. Had he had but common Prudence, He might well have thought, that for one Petit private man hid in à corner of the world, pertly to riſe up againſt all ancient Fathers, Doctors, and Divines, without Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Proofs reduced to ſound Principles, would never take, But appear to every Iudicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
<pb facs="tcp:96808:10"/> as it is) an unluckly Management of an ill cauſe. Herein, without all doubt Paſsion blinded the man, And I am ſure left him no clear Ey-Sight when he too boldly tell's us above, That be relies on our own Writers in this Controverſy, and thinks himſelfe not miſtaken, I ſay once mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the Pretence, is moſt falſe, having not ſo much as one Catholick Author that oppoſes appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Miracles. But ſuppoſe one or two could be racked to his Sence, (hitherto <hi>I</hi> neuer met with any) might not the Dr haue called to mind his <hi>own Apology</hi> made in behalfe of <hi>Mr Thorndick,</hi> Who as Zealously clear's the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church from Idolatry, as the Dr fondly laies that foul Aſperſion on Her? <hi>If we should grant</hi> (They are the Dr's words in his General Preface) <hi>That He</hi> (Mr Thorndick) <hi>held ſome things ſingular in this matter, what is that to the conſtant Opinion of our Church?</hi> So ſay I, should we grant (which I shall neuer yeild) that ſome one or other Catholick Author were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in this matter now debated, what's that to the contrary Iudgement of all other Writers, and the Sentiment of à whole Church beſides? But now when the Dr has none that ſides with him, His only courſe will be to ſit down ſilent, and talk no more of <hi>our Writers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By what is hitherto ſaid, T' is hard, methinks, to conceive what moved the Dr to quarrel with our Miracles. Has God angred the man in Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing ſo many clear Legible Characters Written by his own powerful hand, intending thereby
<pb facs="tcp:96808:10"/> to make his Church glorious? <hi>I ſay many,</hi> For there is no Kingdom (Saith S. Chryſoſtom) no Country, no common wealth, no famous City in the world, where innumerable have not either ſeen or heard of Miracles atteſted by moſt faithful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and upon that Account haue rendred hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thanks to God for ſo ſignal Teſtimonies of his favours. It may bee the Dr thinks that thoſe who have Written of Miracles are but à few on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Vulgar and ignorant. It is à Cavil. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtout Champions, inferiour to none in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge have defended them, Theſe are our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants, and Conquerours in this Controverſy. But perhaps theſe learned only recount ſome Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial matters, or as the Dr ſpeak's <hi>à few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Things.</hi> Quite contrary. They mention moſt Signal Works, great Wonders, as <hi>ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Dead, reſtoring ſight to the blind,</hi> and <hi>curing incurable Infirmities,</hi> clear effects of God only Omnipotent. But ſtay, have not our Learned Writers, willing to wave pains, ſlightly paſſed over ſuch Matters of Fact? No. Never any were, or can be more accurate in laying forth the Subſtance and all Circumſtances relating to Miracles, than <hi>S. Irenaeus, S. Hierom, S. Auguſtine, S. Gregory Thaumatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and <hi>S. Bernard.</hi> Theſe Admirable Saints (to omit latter Authors) have either wrought great Miracles, or Written of them with ſo much care and diligent Study, That one with halfe an Ey may perceive; As They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves never doubted of what they wrote, ſo they
<pb facs="tcp:96808:11"/> purpoſely ſtrove to fix à firm Belief of them in the minds of others. Hence S. Auguſtine cited af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward Lib. 22. de Civit. Cap. 8. aſſures us, He vvrote the Miracles there ſpecifyed for this End, that they might be publickly read before the People, and knovvn to all; For ſaith the Saint. <hi>Such was my expreſs will, Becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe when we ſaw the Signs and Miracles wrought frequently in our time, like thoſe which God anciently evidenced to the world, I endeavovred that their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory should not perish.</hi> If therefore Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles have been frequent, If knovvn the vvho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le vvorld over, If ſeen and atteſted by Many Ey-Witneſſes, if legible Characters Written by God's own hand, if great and prodigious; If finally wrought for <hi>this End,</hi> that their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory might be preſerved and known to all; VVhat could induce our unadviſed Dr moſt rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to publish his lame and imperfect Enquiry against Miracles? This to me appear's à Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, or rather à Riddle which no Oedipus can ſolve.</p>
            <p>Had not this man shown Spight enough in his former Treatiſes, vvhere he ſet's that Vile and Infamous Mark of Idolatry upon our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, though She drevv vvhole Nations from Idolatry to the Chriſtian Faith? But thanks be to God. He has not, (as I hear) gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned three Iudicious men of his ovvn Profeſſion to believe him. Had He not ſpit out Venome enough in stiling the moſt Learned vvith in this
<pb facs="tcp:96808:11"/> great Moral Body <hi>Rebel teachers,</hi> and <hi>Sowers of Diviſions?</hi> Had he not in ſome Frolick gnash't his teeth enough in his more than bold preſumptious railing at the Saints in Heaven? How could à renowned <hi>S. Benet, S. Dominick,</hi> or <hi>S. Francis,</hi> fall under his lash, and raiſe up ſo much unruly Paſſion in à Dr? Could he not he have left theſe happie Souls in their eternal Reſt free from his Scratches, Taunts, aend bitter Obloquies? Without doubt he look't on them as ſome of old did on the wild beaſts in Theaters, publickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be bated, and furiouſly encountred. Yet to make the burthen of his ſins more heavy, he ſports himſelfe with all that can be ſerious. Do but mention the Sanctity and Auſterity of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands yet living in the Church, all with him is thought Hypocriſy. Speak of our Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, taught his Progenitors for à thouſand years and more, it Led them, forſooth, into ſo many abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Errours, that 'tis hard to ſay, whether they are ſaved or damned. Bring to light the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Miracles God ever wrought. what are they? <hi>Nothing but painted Strawes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Trances.</hi> And thus he add's Sin to Sin without remorſe or check of Conſcience, upheld by no other Principles than <hi>Drollery,</hi> vain <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,</hi> lowd untruths, and Calumnies. Dr Iohn Avila, à man of great learning and à renowned Preacher hearing, ſoon after the death of à Prieſt, of one ſole neglect and t'was, that but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce only he had offered up in his whole life time the Holy Sacrifice of the Maſs, ſpake theſe few but
<pb facs="tcp:96808:12"/> weighty words. <hi>Multum defert ad Iudicem</hi> This man upon that Account, carries much with him to be anſwered for before his Iudge. VVhat was this little ſmall Omiſſion compared with Dr Stillingfleet's enormous Commiſſions? Dovvn Cries He vvith their Sacrifice, avvay vvith their Maſs all is Superstition, and the hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſt Idolatry, He might yet have called to mind that the very graveſt of the English Clergy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend (vvhether truly, I diſpute not) to have received the Order of Prieſthood from the hands of our Catholick Bishops, and I am ſure the Dignity of à Prieſt neceſſarily implies the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vver of offering up Sacrifice, though the Dr has been ſo far from complying vvith that one duty his vvhole life long, that had his povver equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l'd his Malice, neither Prieſt nor Sacrifice, had novv remained in the vvorld. Believe it Reader, for this and many other Clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sins. <hi>Multum deferet ad Iudicem.</hi> The Dr vvithout Serious Repentance, vvill have much to Anſvver for at his dying Day.</p>
            <p>Had He in Lieu of oppoſing Miracles told us, that his beloued <hi>Puritaniſme,</hi> though lately brought into the vvorld may notvvitſtanding be bugg'd by him as his Deareſt Benjamin, or ovvned as the ſvveeteſt Religion, being never invented to Curbe Paſſion, or trouble any vvith Auſterity, but chiefly to pamper up à fevv Miniſters vvith their Feminine follovvers, None could have vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. The very moſt might have ſaid the man ſpake as he thought. Nay more; had he been ſo
<pb facs="tcp:96808:12"/> wiſe as to leave this Buſtle of Polemicks to others far above him in learning, or only kept within the Bounds of Speculative Matters, and there blundered and erred, as he has done, The ſubtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that knowledge, and his little skill in ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, would have born out an excuſe, and pleaded in his behalfe. But to run headlong, and proclaime open war againſt plain <hi>Matters of fact</hi> ſeen by thouſands, and furiouſly to encounter God's own <hi>Signal wonders</hi> clearly shovvn to the vvorld, is an Offence of ſo high à nature, and ſo contrary to common Prudence, that though the Dr lived Ages, he shall never vvash off the ſtain vvhich his unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſion has caſt upon him.</p>
            <p>One vvord, and I end. My hope is, Mr Dr vvill take courage and Anſvver this Treatiſe, if ſo; I heartily vvish he talk no more of dravving off the vvhole Subſtance here ſet dovvn into the narrovv compaſs of à fevv lines, That's impoſſible, vvhen ſo many plain Matters of Fact as are novv offer'd him to examin, neceſſarily require no doging, but à full and ſerious Reply. Neither is it enough to tell us, he hold's not himſelfe obliged to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>every Idle Book</hi> that comes forth, and bear's his name in the Title; That vvill bevvray his Ignorance, and too plainly confirme the Opinion moſt have of him, vvhich is, That he cannot Anſvver. But above all, let him not run to one of his <hi>Hocus Pocus</hi> Tricks, or Say; He vvould fain fly at his Adverſary, but novv cannot, being vvholly taken up with ſome other
<pb facs="tcp:96808:13"/> great work againſt Popery. Such far fetcht ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes Argue à cowardly Proceeding, For, Reader, euer to be brandishing his ſowrd, and threaten (without hurt to any) and neuer to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, when attacked, is contrary to the Stile and ſtrain of all Writers ancient and Modern, who firſt endeavour their Adverſaries Satisfaction, And then begin with vvhat nevv attempts they pleaſe. The Dr, I am ſure, has vvork enough cut out for him. Firſt thoſe particulars clearly laid forth in the Preface to my laſt Treatiſe (all waved by the Dr) are many: That excellent learned Book entituled <hi>Dr Stillingfleet againſt Dr Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet,</hi> lately printed, highly, methinks, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves an Anſvver, and I am ſure (to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of others) he is yet behind hand vvith his vvorthy Adverſary N. O. We liue in hopes theſe Debts vvill be paid at last, And that the Dr vvhen his Paſſion is allayed, may give ſuch honeſt men as have taken pains for him ſome reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Satisfaction. Novv in caſe he turn's all off vvith Quibbles, pritty Ierks, and ſuch like Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices, The vvorld vvill Iudge as I do, that Dr Stillingfleet vvas moſt unfortunate in begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning à Quarrel about Polemicks, vvhich as he has not hitherto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo never shall be hereafter, End vvith Credit.</p>

Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that à Miracle has à neceſſary connexion withtruth, and when known as ſuch, gives us In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible certainty of that for which it is primarily intended.

Pray you reflect, would an Oath in à mortal man, though liable to deceipt, be horrid if taken to depoſe à falshood? None doubts it.

                  </gap>d, could he, that cannot deceive, work one; (for example, raiſe the dead) to teſtify à lowd untruth. Hence alſo followes à ſecond impoſſibility, and 'tis,<note place="margin">The power of working Miracles, not tyed to men's fancy.</note> that God cannot give the power of working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to any when and in what manner man's fancy likes beſt, for could this be done, He would not only deprive himſelfe of his own ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Dominion, but alſo rashly ſubject it to the will of another, who by malice or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96808:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> may abuſe it, and publich errour in ſtead of truth. As great an impoſſibility is it, if not greater, that an infinit wiſdom ever work à Miracle to confirm à falſe Doctrin, becauſe an Infinit truth cannot contradict himſelfe, or give Teſtimony to à lye, nor force an errour upon rational creatures ſubject to him, by his own noble and glorious works.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence alſo it is, that none of our late Reformers in Germany, or England, ever wrought à Miracle to confirme one of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties. No wonder, ſaith <hi>Petra Sancta, Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores</hi>

Here you have alſo the true reaſon why Dr Stillinfleet, though without ſucceſſe, ſett's ſo briskly againſt Miracles. Alas! the poor man has none to embellish his new faith with, and therefore would fain have thoſe glorious wonders valued of as needleſſe ſuperfluities, worth little but contempt. He may yet remember how earneſtly Luther ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avovred to work à Miracle in freeing one poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with à Divel, and alſo call to mind, how the Divel had like to have ſtrangled him in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, had not violence been uſed to reſcue Luther.

No ſooner had the wretch ſet his foot in the Bath, but in place of the Holy Ghoſt, à fearful Divel appeared, and firſt carried him into the air, then to the horrour of all the Spectators, ſtrangled him in the water. Theſe things I briefly relate out of approved Authors, chieflly to show how different the genius of theſe men was from our Dr<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, they fancied Miracles ſo ſtrong à ſupport to their new Goſpel, that nothing could ſet it off better, or more advance it, our Dr contrary to his Progenitors ſpirit, will have all later Miracles blaſted, or of no account, becauſe, forſooth, he has none to glory in. Thus much only in paſſing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We now go on in our diſcourſe, and show an abſolute neceſſity of Miracles chiefly at the firſt propagation of the Goſpel, becauſe the high Myſteries of our faith, which require à firm aſſent, and an humble ſubmiſſion to the firſt Verity revealing truth, cannot ſtand faſt, unleſs it rely upon à moſt certain foundation, and this muſt either be an <hi>Evidence of the truth</hi> revealed (not granted in this life) or the moſt Supream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity imaginable, I mean the <hi>Divine</hi> veracity which neither can deceive, or be deceived.

               <p n="4">4. Courteous Reader, pleaſe now to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der à little. Is it true that God endued his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Moſes with the grace of working Miracles?
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96808:19"/> Did he manifeſt great Sign's at the Promulgation of the law in Mount Sina? Did he the like, when Aaron was ordained Prieſt?

Did he ennoble Solomons Temple with illuſtrious Miracles? <hi>Ecce plus quam Salomon hic.</hi> We are now to mind you of à more miraculous Prophet than Moſes, of à more Miraculous Prieſt than Aaron, of à more Miraculous Preacher than the Baptiſt, of à Lawgiver as Miraculous as ever pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished law, finally of à more Miraculous Edifice, than Solomon erected, <hi>I mean the noble houſe of God, the Militant and Triumphant Church of Chriſtians,</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by no other than our great Thaumaturgus, our ever glorious and renowned Lord JESUS, God and Man, whoſe Miracles manifeſted here on earth, ſurpaſſed in true worth and excellency all the wonders of men and Angels. Of this ſubject I am now to ſpeak, and will endeavour ſo to clear our Saviours Miracles, and thoſe the Apoſtles wrought from all doubts and Cavils, that none shall hereafter oppoſe them upon any rational Principle.

And now I trouble not his head with the Queſtion about the Divine Inſpiration
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96808:20"/> of either book but only enquire after their truth: In caſe he yeild's equal truth to both he muſt grant, that <hi>Chriſt cured the blinde, raiſed the dead,</hi> and that the Apoſtles wrought ſuch Miracles, as S. Luke recount's in the Acts of thoſe bleſſed men &amp;c. If, as is moſt likely; he bluntly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject's the Goſpels relation, as not true, I ask what anſwer will he give à Heathen, that no leſs boldly caſt's off the Story of Moſes Miracles as falſe, and plainly aſſert's, that the ſame reaſon (let it be what you will) whereby he attempts to diſcountenance the truth of one Narration, will every whit as much enervate the truth of the other, and thus all Miracles related in Scripture goe to wreck, which is to ſay, God never wrought any by Moſes and the Prophets, by Chriſt and his Apoſtles. This the man of the Synagogue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, or nothing. In caſe he reply, Chriſtians that admit Moſe's Miracles are tongue tyed, and cannot plead againſt them, I anſwer we plead not againſt any, for we hold all moſt true, yet juſtly tax à Iew of à groſſe Inconſequence, (which à Heathen laies before his eyes) and once more ſay, the ſame proofs and reaſons, whereby he endeavour's to reject the Miracles of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, deſtroy at one blow the truth of the greateſt Miracles which Moſes or the Prophets ever wrought, that is in à word, there is neither proof nor reaſon to deny either, all are moſt true and Strongly made out by reaſon, ſuppoſing this one rational ground which none can deny viz. <hi>That books of Hiſtory known and received all over, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve credit upon humane faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. In diſcourſing with à Heathen about Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles<note place="margin">Heathens alſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced.</note> recorded in Scripture, à rational demand is, whether he yeild's as good credit to the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96808:20"/> of this Book, as to Titus Livius, Caeſars Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, or any other ancient writer? If he affirm, the Miracles there ſet down are with him upon moral certainty believable, in caſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, I am not to take his bare word, but muſt know the ultimate reaſon of his denial, which will ever be <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> or in real truth no reaſon, but à ſelfe conceipted fancy, juſt as if one should ſenceleſly reject, what ever Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy or Caeſar has written, becauſe he will bluntly<note place="margin">A reply anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered.</note> do ſo upon no reaſon. The Heathen may reply. There is à great difference between all natural hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory and the Miracles regiſtred in Scripture, for theſe, becauſe ſtrange and unuſual, ſo ſtrongly check and abate beliefe, that reaſon cannot but boggle, and hold all forged by à few ſimple men that wrote them, whereas no ſuch extravagant wonders, are found in natural Hiſtory. I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer firſt, we read of innumerable great wonders in natural Hiſtory, as of Mountains riſing up and juſtling together, of certain Cities in Syria ſeated on hills, and thence violently thrown into à Plain ſome miles off, without any dammage &amp;c. Things certainly unuſual, though not ſo ſtrange as à true Miracle. I anſwer 2. All matters of<note place="margin">Matters of fact in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture not fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned, but manifeſtly proved true.</note> fact recorded in Scripture moſt evidently are not feigned, however admirable and above the force of nature, therefore its highly againſt reaſon to hold the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged becauſe ſtrange and wonderful. I prove de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively that matters of fact recorded in Scripture are not feigned upon this ground. The Prophets long before Chriſtianity was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, foretold clear matters of fact, which ſome thouſands of years after evidently proved true, as that Chriſt should be born of à Virgin,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96808:21"/> that the old Prieſthood should fail, and à new Prieſt and King raign forever, that the greater people, the Iewes, should become the leſs, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils far leſſer become the greater, all ſtrange and wonderful Predictions, whereunto we may add our Saviours moſt certain Propheſy, in that known Parable of the vineyard, where ſpeaking to the chief Prieſts and Phariſies, he clearly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told their ruin and rejection before it happened, and no leſſe clearly the deſtruction of Hieruſalem. Theſe Propheſies the whole world has now ſeen for many Ages fulfilled and verifyed. Hence I diſcourſe, whoever fortel's wonderful future things long before the event, which afterwards viſibly come to paſſe, ſpeak's truth, and cannot forge nor feign, becauſe Facts exactly agreeing with the Predictions take away all ſuſpicion of forgery, but this you ſee is evident, if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Propheſies of the old Teſtament with what the Writers of the new have expreſſed, and we ſe fulfilled with our eyes, therefore all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful matters recorded in Scripture, however ſtrange, are neither falſe nor forged. A Heathen cannot deny the evident and now known fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of theſe Propheſies, becauſe the Book of the old Teſtament was extant, and read by Iewes, long before the Evangeliſts wrote their Story.</p>

               <p n="10">10 Certain Prieſts among the Iewes being preſent grew angry, and wished the Sibyl to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe from ſuch terrible words, but she coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly checked their incredulity, and went on with her Prophecy relating to our Saviour.

Here you have ſome part of our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Bedes relation, what is omitted you may eaſily find in the Author together with à larger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription given of the other five Suns, now not pertinent to my preſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="11">11. To this Teſtimony you may well add what<note place="margin">Euſeb Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor Eccleſ. lib. 1. c. 2.</note> Euſebius writes of the Emperour Tiberius, where we are told, that He hearing of the Miracles wrought by our Saviour, and upon the clear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations given by Pilates letter of Chriſts ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing<note place="margin">Tiberius the Emperour Striving to honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt, was oppoſed.</note> from the dead after three dayes, Tiberius would have placed him amongſt the Gods, but the Senate oppoſed the deſigne, as à Novelty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Lawes, notwithſtanding, ſaith Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, in his Apology for Chriſtians, Tiberius was ſo far from altering his judgement concerning the Sanctity and Miracles done by Chriſt, that he ever thought moſt honourably of them, and more over threatned punishment to all that accuſed Chriſtians, or hindred the Propagation of their Faith. If therefore Iewes, Turks, and Heathens highly valued our Saviours Miracles as you have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96808:23"/> heard, and all Chriſtians conſpire in à truth ſo openly received, we may well conclude that their Fame is very univerſal, and upon humane faith (for ſtill we keep within the bounds of arguing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally) morally ſpeaking, moſt certain.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Hence I proceed to the ſecond part of<note place="margin">The force of publick Fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me.</note> my Aſſertion and prove that à Fame ſo univerſal concerning matters of fact, grounded upon ſenſe or Ey-ſight, and never rationally contradicted, is upon humane faith Without further debate moſt undoubted. But the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles were once thus objects of ſenſe, ſeen by many diſtinct perſons, and at different times, who cannot be ſuppoſed either Maliciouſly to feign innumerahle horrid Lies, or clancularly to agree by common conſent in avouching ſuch matters to have been truly ſeen with eyes, which never we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſeen, this, I ſay is morally impoſſible, and obſerve my Proof. Allow the Hiſtorical part of the new Teſtament ſo much worth, as both Iewes and Gentils grant to any ordinary good Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian; I require no more; We read there, that many ſaw Lazarus raiſed from the dead, others the blinde man cured, others the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers cleanſed, others the infirm made whole,<note place="margin">No forgery in thoſe who ſaw Chriſts Miracles.</note> by à word of our Saviours mouth &amp;c. I ask whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any can prudently conceive, that theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Ey-wisneſſes at ſome time or other met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and conſpired thus foolithly among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>So many of us shall avouch (and falſly) they ſaw Lazarus raiſed to life that was not truly dead, ſo many shall ſay, they ſaw the Lepers cleanſed,</hi> the Sick reſtored to health, though no ſuch wonders were ever done by Chriſt, yet let us boldly blaze the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe things abroad, and ſtand to the hazard, <hi>follow what will.</hi> Is ſuch à forgery likely or believable?
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96808:23"/> No, it is improbable, upon this convincing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>Forgery and fiction uſually playes tricks in obſcure matters à far of,</hi> (as in feigned viſions or pretended Revelations) not obvious to ſenſe, but in things ſenſible, neer at hand, publick, and viſible Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, becauſe moſt eaſily diſcovered, becomes its own ruin, and point blanck, like witleſs po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, fruſtrat's the end aimed at, as plainly appear's in many pretended falſe Miracles, which, when made manifeſt (as often falls' out) have not only brought condign punishment, but more-over Shame and diſgrace upon the Authors.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Upon this ground alſo, we evidently<note place="margin">Nor in those who writh the Goſpel.</note> clear our ſacred Writers of the new Teſtament from all fraud and forgery, in their plain Narration of our Saviours Miracles. Reflect I beſeech you, what man endued with common prudence can work him ſelfe into this perſwaſion, that the four Evangeliſts, who candidly ſet down the ſufferan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the opprobrious death of their Lord and Maſter (wherein, as all confeſſe, they ſpeake truth) in ſome ſtrange Frolick or other, met together and agree'd to tell à falſe lye of Lazarus raiſed to life, of infirme reſtored to health, that were never<note place="margin">What preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice fraud would have done the Evangeliſts.</note> ſick  Had this fraud been invented, they had not only notoriouſly prejudiced their own cauſe, but the Intereſt alſo of their great Maſter; nay; the very Iewes would have decryed all the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles they wrote of, as publick impoſtures, and, if feigned, might juſtly have pleaded. No eyes ever ſaw them wrought whenas the contrary is manifeſt, for they highly dreaded our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Miracles, and held them ſo attractive, that if permitted to go on, the whole world would follow him. Hence it is that, that ungodly People, never dared in any Tribunal juridically to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96808:24"/> call into doubt the truth of his greateſt Miracles (though ſome whisperers ſaid he caſt out Divels by the help of Divels) No; all knew they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him to death (not becauſe the cure of the blind man, or raiſing Lazarus from death were judged Impoſtures) but upon this account, that final Sentence was given, becauſe he made him ſelfe the Son of God.</p>
               <p n="14">14. By all hitherto ſaid we ſe. 1. How and in what manner true Miracles, objects of ſenſe, gained repute in the world, and became credible. Firſt witneſſes worthy beliefe not ſuſpected of<note place="margin">By what means Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned esteem.</note> Guile ſaw them wrought, and upon their faithful word communicated with other's the wonders they had ſeen, as certain and undoubted. 2. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe firſt Hearers, finding no reaſon to queſtion the fidelity of Ey-witneſſes (juſtly reputed honeſt,) prudently yeilded aſſent to the Narration, and imparted to others what they had received from thoſe who ſaw the Miracles, In Proceſſe of time the Report of thoſe wonders ſpread far and neer, gained more ground, till at laſt à publick Fame owned them certain. This Fame held on Age after Age, handed down by conſtant Tradition, never, as I ſaid, rationally contradicted, is now general the whole Univerſe over, and every way Comparable with the Fame we have of Alexander, the great, Julius Caeſar, and other known <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,</hi> whereof no prudent man ever doubted. Obſerve I beſeech you, how equally the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel run's in both caſes. Caeſar and Pompey (plain Objects of ſenſe) are proved to have had once being in the world, becauſe ſeen by many; But Chriſt our Lord and his Apoſtles, no leſſe objects of ſenſe, were as viſible, the parity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hold's good. 2. The Geſts and noble Acts
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96808:24"/> of Caeſar firſt ſeen, Records afterwards preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,<note place="margin">None can force him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to deny à truth owned upon Vniverſal Fame.</note> and as good Records are extant for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable works and Wonders of our Saviour. 3. The Fame of thoſe <hi>Heroes</hi> and their Geſts taking its firſt riſe from Senſe became in time Univerſal, and handed down by Tradition, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves yet ſo vigorouſly in the minds of all men, that no owner of this publick Fame can by any violence force himſelfe to judge, that <hi>Caeſar ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was in being, never fought battle, the whole Story of Alexander is à fourb</hi> &amp;c. Thus alſo the Fame of Chriſt, of the Apoſtles and their Wonders, once ſenſible, and yet upheld by à perpetuated Tradition, ſtill remain's ſo fixed in all minds, that unleſs this publick Fame perish, which is impoſſible, the matters of Fact ſupported by it, are without Conteſt undeniable. Hence I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this Queſtion, whether à Iew or Gentile can by violence force his intellectual Power to judge, <hi>Such à man as Chriſt,</hi> ſuch <hi>men as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, were never in the world?</hi> You will ſay No, becauſe they are Truths Univerſally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, notwithſtanding the very moſt of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers boldly deny the Miracles we ſpeak of, and why should not their Authority as much evince A <hi>Negative,</hi> or prove no ſuch Miracles done, as the contrary Teſtimony of Chriſtians avail for the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> in ſaying Chriſt really wrought Miracles.</p>
               <p n="15">15. To Anſwer the difficulty, you have here an undoubted Principle. Clear Poſitive proofs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt for an <hi>Affirmative,</hi> quite bear down, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh in true worth, à contrary <hi>Negative</hi> bluntly maintained without ſemblance of Proof. Should therefore the greateſt part of men now living barely deny without Proof Alexander or Caeſar
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96808:25"/> ever to have been, or done any memorable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the contrary Poſitive Arguments alledged for their being would manifeſtly Show that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Denyal to be not only weightleſs, but ſenſeleſs alſo, and improbable. And thus I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe in our preſent caſe. Poſitive Ground's irrefragable reaſons, (whereof you shall have à few hints) rationally prove our Saviour and his<note place="margin">An objection anſwered.</note> Apoſtles to have wrought true Miracles, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all contrary Oppoſition, <hi>without Grounds and proofs,</hi> appear's frigid, ſenceleſs, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable. Some Critick may object. Had as many from the firſt riſe of Caeſar oppoſed his being and Heroical Acts, as have gainſaid the Miracles of Chriſt and the Apoſtles from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Chriſtianity, that certainly would have much abated the humane Beliefe all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve now of Caeſar, of Alexander, Cicero, or who you will. I anſwer no Abatement at all, while on the one ſide (and this is ever to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) the Poſitive grounds for the <hi>Affirmative</hi> ſtand in vigour, as they now ſtand, and the Denyal <hi>rigidly examined</hi> for want of proofs, comes to nothing, but to this vain empty, and Idle Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion. <hi>Caeſar, forſooth, never was, or did any thing worth à man, Chriſt never wrought true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</hi> Poſitive proofs therefore brought to light in behalfe of theſe Miracles, enervate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unproved Aſſertion, and show it void of Strength, futile, in à word worth nothing.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Now if you enquire after theſe Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<note place="margin">Reaſ. and Relig. Diſc. 1. cap. 3.</note> proofs, all clear and convincing, whole Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums might be written. Some as I argued, <hi>Reas: and Religs:</hi> remonſtrate the Cauſe by its real effects, and ſet before us à manifeſt Truth, <hi>the known Converſion of the world,</hi> made by Chriſt and his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96808:25"/> Apoſtles without force of Arms or any earthly Allurement, Nay, upon the greateſt disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages imaginable, becauſe however poor and deſpicable in the eyes of all, yet They prevailed againſt the rich, and powerful; and brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable to believe in à Crucifyed man. Was it not now, that the greateſt Philoſophers, the moſt Eloquent Orators, were deem'd leſs wiſe than twelve unlearned Fishermen, and did not God ſet à mark of folly upon humane wiſdom in the noble Conqueſt made by the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that ſpeake in theſe very men, reputed Idiots?

Theſe Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed men who wrote the Hiſtory of the Goſpel and regiſtred our Saviours Miracles with their own, at laſt, as all know, couragiouſly endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red violent deaths, to Teſtify that the Doctrin and Miracles they wrote of, were no Leger-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main but ſincerely true. In doing this, we muſt either judge them horridly impious, or ſtark mad, if they regiſtred matters of Fact that never were, or contrarywiſe own them Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinly inſpired, and faithful Miniſters of their great Lord and Maſter. Say they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, beſotted, or mad, you utter the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Paradox that ever mouth ſpake, and muſt confeſſe that whole multitudes, <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>learned,</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:96808:26"/> were converted to Chriſt by wicked and mad Impoſtors; which proves him or them impious and utterly bereaved of Judgement, that dare upon no ground avouch à Fiction ſo shamful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incredible. Theſe firſt followers of Chriſt therefore, proceeded with all Sincerity, and regiſtred their great Maſters Doctrin, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles moſt faithfully.</p>
               <p n="17">17. A third Proof, methinks Very convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, may be thus propoſed. Should à Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger come amongſt us from the furtheſt Parts of the world, and tell us he hath heard much in his Travels of great wonders done by à man called Jeſus Chriſt, as alſo of Strange Miracles wrought by ſome poor followers Chriſt had, named Diſciples, and very willing he is to be better informed concerning the truth of theſe divulged Wonders. To give this man rational Satifaction, I would in the firſt place put into his hands the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, where the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Matters of Fact are recorded, and next de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whether he can more rationally call into doubt the truth of that Hiſtory (owned by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable<note place="margin">How à Strâ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may be ſatisfyed that doubts of Chriſts Miracles.</note> multitudes à true Book, at leaſt upon humane faith) than in prudence Queſtion the verity of any other Hiſtory he own's true? In caſe he boggles at the Hiſtory, I muſt know Why, and upon what rational ground he bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles? Now this ground, after ſome little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, will appear ſo remote from being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, that it can come at laſt to nothing but à ſelfe conceipted Fancy becauſe it is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to make any more juſt or reaſonable exception againſt the plain Hiſtory of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, than againſt any other known or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved true Story. Thus much cleared, which no
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96808:26"/> Enemy of Chriſt unleſſe moſt unreaſonable can deny, our Stranger caſts his thoughts upon Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes and modern Sectaries, and finds theſe by their own confeſſion ſo deſtitute of Miracles, that none among them can pretend to any, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce Chriſtianity began. Next he peruſes the Goſpel, ſee's with what Candour the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts recount our Saviours Miracles, and ſeems willing enough to hold all true upon humane Faith, becauſe he finds no reaſonable excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt them, yet ſtick's much at one Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, where we are told <hi>of greater works to be</hi>

                  <hi>done by thoſe who believe in Chriſt; than he had wrought.</hi> If this can be made out and verifyed, ſaith the Stranger, Chriſt did not only foretel, future things, which is proper to God, but it followes alſo, that after his death and leaving the world, He did, (as if preſent with ſome choiſe Servants) impower them to perpetuate the like viſible Wonders, he had wrought. Chriſt therefore, Saith he, was either very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in promiſing ſo largely while he lived, if he never performed it, or if he really made all good, he worthily deſerves credit, and ought to be believed before any that hitherto taught the world, for though we read of ſome Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, who gloriouſly ſet forth their own Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, yet none of them dared to Propheſy of doing Miracles after death by others, neither did they, (for ought I know) work any by men of the like Belief or Profeſſion with them. Thus the Travaller diſcourſes, and urges to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve theſe latter Miracles wrought by Chriſts Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants rationally laid forth to an unbyaſſod Judgement. To Satisfy the difficulty here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
               <p n="18">
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:96808:27"/>18. All know that matters of Fact as Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, where of we now diſcourſe, are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Principles taken from natural Cauſes, or the deep knowledge of Metaphyſical learning, for who will go about to show that Caeſar was à glorious Warrier, or Cicero an Eloquent Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, by Metaphyſicks or natural reaſoning? None can attempt this? All therefore that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue pertinently, muſt rely upon other proofs and plead, as we have done, for Apoſtolical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles by the publick Fame of them, ſpread the whole world over, or finally Reaſon thus. It is manifeſt that thoſe firſt Bleſſed men, however weak in them ſelves, without force of Armes ruined the Idols of the Gentils, and converted innumerable to Chriſt, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they wrought great Miracles anſwerable to that Ruin, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Converſions done by them.</p>
               <p n="19">19. To give more force to theſe and the like<note place="margin">Vpon what Principles Miracles are proved.</note> Proofs, I doe not only, as S. Chriſoſtom ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes, take into my hands the Apoſtles Acts written by S. Luke, where we read of ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Miracles, but I alſo reflect upon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours antecedent Promiſe concerning <hi>greater Works,</hi> and further evince the real truth of that Propheſy, by the conſequent viſible Wonders which thoſe firſt bleſſed men wrought here on earth. And firſt I might tell you, it is clear from the Propheſies of the old Scripture, <hi>that the ancient Prieſthood among the Iewes was to fail, and à new King and Prieſt raign for ever, that à Church once barren, should have many Children, as we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved above.</hi> It is again clear, that theſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies were fulfilled when Chriſt our Lord eſtablis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed his own glorious Kingdom the Chriſtian Catholick Church, and though Iewes ſeek to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96808:27"/> darken the light of thoſe clear Predictions, yet it is evident that Chriſt has had à glorious Church in the world above Sixteem Ages, which as Tertullian obſerves, ſtood not confined to one<note place="margin">Tertull. lib adverſus Judaeos cap. 8.</note> or more places, like the Empire of Nabucho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donoſor, or Alexander, but <hi>Vbique porrigitur.</hi> &amp;c. has à vaſt extent, <hi>is believed every where Reign's every where, and is reverenced in all places.</hi> Hence I Argue.

That the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Witneſſes are mighty numerous, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout diſpute worthy credit is undeniable, being juſtly liſted amongſt the moſt wiſe, learned, and virtuous that ever lived. Such are our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins, Chryſoſtoms, Gregories, Damaſcens, Bernards,</hi> with innumerable others, who if occaſion had offered it ſelfe, would have willingly dyed for the truth of Apoſtolical Miracles. Now if theſe Givers in of Evidence Seem not Satisfactory, you have yet more. viz. The whole <hi>humane Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:96808:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Chriſts Kingdom, I mean his Church, She both tell's us what our Saviour promiſed of theſe greater wonders, and upon the Evidence had, never ceaſed to preſerve them in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of all her Faithful Children to this day.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And thus you ſee, that when we took one Proof for Miracles from publick Fame (which ſome may ſay is fallacious) we argued not ſo preſſly as now, while we evince their truth by the Teſtimony of the moſt choiſe, learned, and creditable Witneſſes that ever ſpake ſince Chriſtianity began. And if our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Stranger find's not à Pregnancy of reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in this Diſcourſe, I shall ſoon diſmiſſe him, and deplore his condition as one in whom the light of reaſon (if not utterly extinct) ſeem's more then à little Eclypfed.

Again, conſider à Miracle as done by one that has no more force to work it than to move the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, under that Notion it juſtly acquires the denomination of an effect truly Supernatural, becauſe far beyond all force in nature. You may ſe what I aime at by this plain Inſtance. Should à Giant lift up à weighty burthen, all would Judge he work's proportionably to his Strength, but if à weak infant did so, who would not juſtly proclaim the wonder? The Miracles of Chriſt our Lord (rightly compared to à
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96808:28"/> Giant in Holy Writ) were effects eaſily and Connaturally flowing from the Omnipotent <hi>Word,</hi> united to humane nature, infinitly, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, more valuable than all the works of men and Angels, but yet leſſe wonderful than the Apoſtolical Miracles, if on the one ſide we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the mighty Power of our great <hi>Thaumatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and on the other, caſt an eye upon tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe weak Inſtruments that did them.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96808:29"/> you, is not à Sectary when he read's the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Holy Fathers, and other known Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians where the approved Miracles of the Church ſtand upon Record, in reaſon obliged, to hold theſe as morally certain <hi>upon humaine Faith,</hi> as he doth innumerable other Paſſages written in the English, or French Hiſtory, or à Iew ought to own the Hiſtory of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?

Thus our profeſſed Adverſaries.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is it true that the Miracles of Chriſt and the Apoſtles (plain Objects of Senſe) were firſt proved by the Teſtimony of thoſe that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them, and that thoſe who ſaw them (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Ey-witneſſes) at different times, cannot be imagined willingly to have conſpired in à For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, or baſely given out Lazarus for à dead man, raiſed to life, that was not dead? Is it alſo true, that the Evangeliſts, who afterwards regiſtred theſe ſeen Wonders, had they told ſo many horrid Lyes in matters of Fact open and publick (where fiction has not eaſily place) would not only have prejudiced their own cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, but alſo been lyable to Publick infamy, and the diſgraceful Clamours of Iewes and Gentils? If theſe Truths be undeniable, we have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke rational Evidence for Miracles wrought in the Roman Catholick Church. Reader conſider<note place="margin">An applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the third Proof</note> things ſeriouſly. Was not that Miracle wrought by the Reliques of S. Gervaſius and Protaſius in Milan, witneſſe S. Ambroſe, an Object of<note place="margin">S. Ambroſ. Epiſt. 85.</note> Senſe, and ſeen by many? Were thoſe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious wonders effected by the glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr S. Stephen, whereof S.

Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard's Miracle after his bleſſing certain loaves of bread (whereof we shall ſpeak preſently) ſo
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96808:30"/> memorable, and manifeſt to Senſe, that whole Multitudes having eaten of the bread finding themſelves cured, ran forthwith to the Saint, and with all ſubmiſſion prayſing God, owned the Favour? John Clements cure at Montagu, the young youths reſtored Leg at Zaragoſa, and the Miraculous cure of F. Maſtrilli at Naples, were all Senſible and viſible Works of à Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power. Say now I beſeech you, (to goe on with the Parallel,) can any Imagin, that either thoſe who ſaw, or wrote theſe Miracles, damnedly conſpired among them ſelves, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the world with open Lies? It is impoſſible, becauſe Spectators or writers of ſuch matters li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved far more diſtant (for time and place) from each other, than the Apoſtles that regiſtred our Saviours wonders. If therefore thoſe bleſſed men cannot be ſuppoſed wickedly to have feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chriſt's raiſing Lazarus to life, or cleanſing the Lepers, it is more impoſſible to conceive, that S. Auſtin (for example) perſwaded thoſe who lived many Ages after with S. Bernard, to tell à forged Story of his miraculous Loaves. Did thoſe. think you, who ſaw the youth's reſtored leg at Zaragoſa ſuborne the Ey-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of John Clements cure at Montagu, to feign that matter of Fact, which happened ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years before the Miracle at Zaragoſa? It is Folly to Judge ſo.</p>
               <p n="4">4. O but, ſay Sectaries, we doubt much whether the ſuppoſed Ey-witneſſes of Latter Miracles, and the Writers of them ſpake truth, in what Thoſe firſt are ſaid to have ſeen; That is They'l doubt, whether any ſaw the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles recounted by S. Auſtin, and S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, and Queſtion as much theſe Saints Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96808:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> in writing them. And cannot á Iew or Heathen move all theſe doubts Concerning to Eywitneſſes of our Saviours Miracles, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts Sincerity that wrote them? Yea every whit as wiſely. Reader in this place, we only compare the humane Teſtimony of thoſe who ſaw Chriſt's Miracles, before Scripture regiſtred them, with the humane Teſtimony of latter wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that viſibly beheld the Miracle at Milan, at Montagu, or Naples, and ſay no more rational exception can be made againſt the latter Ey-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes than the firſt. Now becauſe in diſcourſing with the Adverſaries of Chriſt, and his Church, it were folly to ſuppoſe the Goſpel God's Divine Word, we clearly evince by reaſon, that the Book at leaſt deſerves as great Credit, upon<note place="margin">No exception can be made against tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe who write of approved Miracles.</note> humane Faith, as any other true plain Hiſtory, And then tell Sectaries, that they in reaſon can-no more except againſt the approved Writers of our Church Miracles (S. Auſtin for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or S. Ambroſe) than à Iew or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then againſt the Evangeliſts that wrote Chriſts Miracles, and hence you have the Primitive Miracles, and thoſe in the Church prove ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke. Laſtly would not the Evangeliſts (now ſuppoſed to write candidly their Story, without any fraudulent Combination) have juſtly expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them ſelves to publick Infamy in ſetting down matters of Fact, had they (ſingly conſidered) recorded things newer Seen or heard? No leſſe publick Infamy, Cenſure, and Clamours thoſe would have juſtly Incurred in relating Church Miracles, had they brought to light ſtrange Wonders, never known in the world. Would publick Clamours think ye, or Cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res have ſpared S. Auſtin, or thoſe that recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96808:31"/> John Clement's Cure, if forged and feigned Stories? No certainly, men both wiſe and prudent would have excepted againſt them as Impoſtures, had not Evidence cleared their Truth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Is it true that the Miracles of Chriſt firſt ſeen by Ey-witneſſes and afterwards recorded, raiſed them to à Publick Fame the whole world over, which hitherto continues in force by à never interrupted Tradition? The like publick Fame, ſay I, firſt grounded on Senſe and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto continued by Tradition, we have for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought in the Church.

Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, it is true are found, that Queſtion the Truth of ſome Church Miracles (none for ought I know, unleſſe D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stillingfleet denies all) and no few Deſertors of the Church, Queſtion alſo whether many Parts and Paſſages in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament are God Sacred Word: But the great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of clear Miracles, and the new Teſtaments Divinity, is even upon the Churches <hi>humane Authority</hi> upheld, as indubitable by all called Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, and therefore very univerſal, yea anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werable to the Fame of Apoſtolical Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Is it true that Poſitive proofs alledged for this Affirmative. <hi>Chriſt truely wrought Miracles,</hi> quite diſcountenance and bear down the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>Negative,</hi> barely vented without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of proof? <hi>Chriſt never wrought any.</hi> The Principle is undoubted, and clearly evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that God has wrought many true Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96808:32"/> by the Profeſſed members of the Catholick Church. Our Poſitive proofs you shall have afterwards more fully, and the contradiction of thoſe who deny Miracles demonſtrated an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Attempt, yea void of Sence, and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. In this place we only Argue as we did above, and show the cauſe, <hi>Miracles I mean,</hi> by the real Effects which followed in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Nations, far more numerous after the Apoſtles dayes (and all thoſe wrought by<note place="margin">The fift Proof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to our Churches Miracles.</note> the Roman Catholick Church) than before. Such remarkable Works of God over Italy, Germany, France, Spain, England and the Indies to the Catholick Faith, were, as I pleaded, done by Miracles or not, if ſo done, we have our Intent, if not; it was the greateſt Miracle of all, to ſee ſo many Aliens from Chriſt gained to the true Faith, without Miracles. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, thoſe painful Miſſioners whom God made his Inſtruments to work ſo many admirable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions through the whole world, were in the vulgar eſteem of the Nations converted, held Sots, Impious, and Cheats; or contrarywiſe, Loyal and faithful Meſſengers of Chriſt and his Church; if loyal and faithful, none can caſt à blemish on them; if judged Impoſtors, Sots, or impious, you utter the moſt shameful <hi>Improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> that ever Tongue ſpake, or heart harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and muſt ſay that the wiſeſt Nations of the world were all ſtark mad, when liſtening to the Doctrin of theſe ſuppoſed Fools, they aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned their Errours, believed in Chriſt, and ever afterwards lived and dyed in the Roman Catholick Faith.

Laſtly for à Cloſe of theſe rational Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, I introduced à Stranger yet far from yeilding aſſent to our Church Miracles, and becauſe he knowes that Iewes and Sectaries lay no claim to that gift, nor ever did any ſince the Apoſtles dayes, this man, much of Dr Stillingfleets mind, ſtand's earneſtly for à ceſſation of all Miracles, though if miſled, he is willing to quit his errour. My endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is to unbeguile him, and therefore I ask, whether he denies or grant's the Miracles wrought by Chriſt and his Apoſtles? In caſe he ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles here, you have his full refutation already ſet down, if contrarywiſe he owns thoſe as true, upon publick Fame, and the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions God wrought by them.

The Fame of theſe Wonders by reaſon of the larger extent of the Church now, than anciently, is more Univerſal, and the Converſions made by Her laboriours Meſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſent up and down the world in latter
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96808:33"/> Ages, are far more numerous, than thoſe the Apoſtles wrought. Now if we appeal to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes as we pleaded above for the Apoſtolical Signs and Miracles, there is no Kingdome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun, that ever brought to light ſo many grave Writers (againſt whom no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be made) for any matter of Fact, that happened in it, as we produce in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Controverſy. For all the learned Doctors, and vigilant Paſtors of Chriſts own far exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Kingdom, no leſſe numerous than worthy credit, teach and have ever taught, that true conſpicuous and undeniable Miracles have been wrought in this great moral Body, and the Church Herſelfe, upon her own humane Authority (ſtill we abſtract from Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) aſſerts the ſame, and to this day, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves à Memory of her long ſince paſt, and preſent Wonders, in the minds of all her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

We find by experience à ſtrange confuſion of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sects in the world, and ſe that all pretend to ſerve God in Spirit and Truth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas, moſt certainly, one only Society doth ſo, for as there are not many Gods but one true, ſo there cannot be many Religions (diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting<note place="margin">Miracles denote and mark out that Society wherein God teaches truth.</note> in Fundamentals) true, <hi>but one only, or none at all.</hi> In this horrid Confuſion, while every one laies claim to Truth, it is, as I ſaid, abſolutely neceſſary to have that happie Society clearly marked out, wherein Divine Faith is taught, but no Mark can be more palpable, or better avail to diſcern this Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from falſe Sects than glorious Miracles, <hi>Gods own Seals, Chriſts own Cogniſances, and the cleareſt Characters of Apoſtolical Doctrin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. I Argued. 2. A Church not marked with theſe illuſtrious Signs, is as dark à thing as à Sun without light, whence it is, that though. Two unlucky Rebels, Luther and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, laboured with might and main, to ſet à falſe Gloſſe of Miracles upon their new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, yet God croſſed their deſigne, made the Authors of the fraud infamous, and would have the new Monſter appear as it truly was, <hi>dark without light, dull without life, and ſo totally ſtrip't</hi> of all Supernatural Signs, that Shame and ignominy only covered that naked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;

I Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued.<note place="margin">Iewes and Infidels gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Church by the force of Miracles.</note> 3. If Miracles, as all confeſſe, were neceſſary for the Converſion of Iewes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels when Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught the world, it is à Paradox to hold them uſeleſſe, or unneceſſary in after Ages, when Iewes as hard hearted, and Gentils as barbarous and uncivilized (that never knew Chriſt) have been inſtructed, and innumerable gained to our holy Faith, not becauſe they <hi>barely heard Verities preached,</hi> but upon this Inducement, that they often ſaw all confirmed by Evident Signs and wonders from Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. To goe on in this diſcourſe, I would know whether Dr Stillingfleet can allow the Divel liberty to ranger up and down, and to do much mischiefe upon innumerable poſſeſſed with unclean Spirits, and whether he will grant alſo that Chriſt our Lord like one careleſſe,<note place="margin">The freeing poſſeſſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from Divels, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> leaves his Militant Church deſtitute of all help, and means, whereby ſuch enſlaved Perſons may be freed from that bondage? That ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have been thus poſſeſſed, and releaſed alſo out of thraldome, is an evident Truth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by experience, and that the ejection or reſtraint of evil Spirits tranſcend's all force in nature and conſequently done by Gods Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Power, is no leſſe certain, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore à work truly Miraculous.</p>

Shall he glory in falſe Signs, and the Church show none that are true? So it is ſaith Dr Stillingfleets, your Church Miracles are cheats, and no better than what Divels have done, and Antichriſt will do by his Charms. Is it ſo indeed, are all cheats and works of the Divel? One word<note place="margin">To grant ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Miracles wrought in the Church will much abate Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts pride.</note> Mr Dr. A moderate man in granting ſome Miracles true, would much cheer up the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe hearts of poor afflicted Chriſtians in thoſe future dayes of Tribulation, and teach every one how to withſtand Antichriſt, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting true approved Miracles againſt his jugling Tricks.

Dr Still. may reply. Though all Miracles wrought in the Church be truly deemed Cheats, yet there have been other moſt clear ones, powerful enough to Curbe Antichriſt's Pride, and theſe are the glorious ſignal Wonders of Chriſt, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles alone ſufficient, to diſcountenance that falſe Prophet's Sign's, though never ſo Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Have at you, Mr Dr, ſaith Antichriſt.

Who ever takes the firſt Report in matters of fact from others both falſe and beguiled, is as much cheated and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled, as thoſe Original witneſſes are.

                  <hi>and Daniel Papebrochius,</hi> have amply drawn out, to whom I muſt remit you, for further Satisfaction, and briefly recount the Miracle viſibly wrought upon à Gentlewoman in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais, by the interceſſion of that great Servant of God <hi>S. Franciſcus de Paula;</hi> Founder of à moſt Holy Religious Order, Vulgarly called Minims.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the year 1661. the forenamed Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lewoman<note place="margin">The nature af Peronna's Infirmity.</note> about 30. years old, by name <hi>Peronna Raoult,</hi> daughter to an honourable man called Lewis Raoult, had been 13. whole years gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veouſly afflicted with à violent cough, and ſtoppage at her lungs, cauſed by á continual Defluxion of humours comming from her
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96808:40" rendition="simple:additions"/> head. Phyſicians though often conſulted, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und no remedy, ſaying ingenuouſly, they well knew not the cauſe and nature of her ſtrange Aſthtmatical diſeaſe, which for the four laſt years more and more encreaſing, brought fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and fearful convulſion fits upon the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Patient, whence followed ſuch à contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of nerves and Sinewes in her left Leg, that firſt it became four fingers, ſoon after, halfe à foot shorter than the other. This innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Witneſſes ſaw, and gave Evidence of, as alſo that the bone of her right Leg and Hip put out of joynt; gave her ſuch intolerable pain, that the could not ſit without drawing her body into à round lump, in which Poſture she ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many Sowing fits, and unexpreſſible Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. When the moſt Chriſtian King came to Calais, anno 1658 His Majeſties chief Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician <hi>Mons<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Valet,</hi> and three other expert Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors were there alſo, and ſeveral times viſited the infirm creature, which done, all unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded the infirmity to be incurable, and that poor Peronna was to remain Paralitick all the dayes of her life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thus left confortles, ſtill enduring ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Torment, she thought it high time to implore help from Heaven, and reſolved to make à <hi>Novens,</hi> or nine dayes of prayer by her<note place="margin">Peronna im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence from Heaven.</note> ſelfe or others, to the glorious Saint <hi>Francis of Paula,</hi> and began it in the Minims Church at Calais the fift day within the Saints Octave. Now becauſe of her great weaknes, she could not repair thither without much pain, she of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſent her Maid ſervant to perform the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion for her, yet encouraged to doe ſome thing herſelfe during the <hi>Novens,</hi> though uſually
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96808:40"/> carried to the Church in à chair, she called that day for her Crutches, and with the help of her Maid to hold her up, after many à weariſom ſtep and ſtop in drawing breath, at laſt got to the Church, where she heard Maſſe, (ſaid for her intention) and communicated. When be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold at the reading of the laſt Goſpel, Peron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na felt an exceſſive pain all her body over, but chiefly in her left Leg and both hipps, then all her nerves were violently ſtretched out by à hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, as she thought, diſperſing it ſelfe through every member, and heard the noyſe of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes long out of joint brought again to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural poſture. Immediatly after theſe Torments,<note place="margin">Peronna Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in an Instant by Miracle.</note> the vigour and agility of her whole body were perfectly reſtored in à moment, in ſo much that without help, or the leaſt ſign of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes she roſe up, and knelt before the Altar to the great admiration of all the Beholders. The Prieſt who ſaid Maſſe, by name F. John de Beaumont, when he ſaw her kneeling won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at it, and becauſe he yet knew nothing of the Miracle, adviſed her to fit down. O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid she, bleſſed be God, that is now need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for I am perfectly cured, and as well as, if I had never been infirm. Then she went to the Sacriſty doore and deſired another Maſſe to be ſaid by way of Thanskgiving, for the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful cure wrought upon her, F. Peter Hullin ſaid the Maſſe, whereat she knelt the whole ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, though, as the cuſtome is, roſe up by her ſelfe without difficulty, at the reading of the Goſpel. Maſſe done, She left her Crutches in the Church, and walked home as ſound and ſtrong, as ever she had been in her life. All theſe particulars Peronna depoſed upon Oath as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96808:41"/> moſt true, when she was moſt rigidly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and obliged by Oath, to ſpeak nothing but Truth of the <hi>ſtate,</hi> and <hi>continuance</hi> of her malady, as alſo of the cure, whereunto she ſubſcribed her name <hi>Peronna Roault.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Now if any ſuſpect Fiction or jugling in this Depoſition made by the Gentlewoman (though methinks it is very unlikely, that one who ſtood in no need of any temporal reliefe, should juggle ſo long, or feign an Infirmity for thirteen years together) I anſwer all fear of fraud is taken away upon the manifeſt proof of theſe two things. 1. That the diſeaſe was ſuch in the main particulars as the Patient her ſelfe depoſed. 2. That she was reſtored to perfect<note place="margin">See theſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes named in the firſt Tome of April, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cited.</note> health, as is now ſaid. But no fewer than 16. or 17. ſworn Witneſſes, all named in the Proceſſe (or full information of this Miracle) gave in Evidence of theſe main particulars. To produce every one in order would be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, while hundreds yet living in Calais con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of the Miracle, are ready to Teſtify it. Theſe few therefore shall ſuffice. One, à maid Servant, depoſed she was preſent when Peron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'as Limbs were ſo violently rack't out of joynt, that she heard à noiſe much after the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as if bones had been broken in her body, and ſwore alſo she had often handled and ſeen one of her Legs much shorter than the other, the like Atteſtation other Witneſſes gave. Fr. John Beaumont appointed to hear the infirm Gentelewoman's Confeſſion at her own houſe the laſt Lent before her cure, depoſed upon<note place="margin">Sworn Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of this Miraculous Cure.</note> Oath, that her voice by reaſon of the obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in her breaſt (often intermitted by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual coughing) was ſo low and inarticulate,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96808:41"/> that, though moſt attentive, he had much A doé to underſtand her. Others gave Teſtimony of her frequent Convulſion fits. Others preſent, when the Kings Phyſicians viſited her, after à long conſultation had upon the diſeaſe, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed they heard thoſe knowing Doctors ſay no Cure could be hoped for. So Mons<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Valet Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and the Ordinary Phyſician then of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais Mons<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Crocque depoſed, that after many frequent Viſits made, he had often diſcovered Peronna ſo fearfully aſſaulted with sharp Acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of her malady, and the corrupt humours of her ſtrange diſtempered Body, that he Judged her incurable by humane Art, and therefore left all to God's Divine Providence, and aſſiſtance. Now for as much as concern's the Truth of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronna's ſpeedy recovery perfectly wrought in the Church of the F. F. Minims by the Interceſſion of the glorious S. Francis de Paula, not only the forementioned Witneſſes, but innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble other Inhabitants of Calais, can and will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to this day. So that if humane Faith be not utterly extinct, or of no account among ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional men, the Relation here briefly ſet down, is upon moral Certainty moſt indubitable.</p>

The moſt active in this pious Enterpriſe was the Lord Bishop Richard Succeſſor to S. Thomas, who had long lived with the Saint, and knew much of his Virtues. The Other was Henricus à Schorha, deputed Procurator by the Chapter of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, that preſented à Writing to the Lords Commiſſioners, containing the great reſpect and Veneration all had of the Saint, grounded upon his Virtues and frequent Miracles wrought in à manner dayly at his Monument.

               <argument>
                  <p>How true Miracles may be diſcerned from falſe VVonders. VVhether Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Hereticks ever wrought true Miracles? For what End true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are wrought? Of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Antichriſt's Miracles, and thoſe wrought by Chriſt and in the Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. I Here Suppoſe, that true Miracles ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve been wrought by Moſes, Chriſt our Lord, and his Apoſtles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently are diſcernable from all falſe Signs done by Divels and Impoſtors, or if they be not diſcernable by ſome clear Marks, but ſtill remain <hi>Equivocal,</hi> or lie ſo far out of ſight, that none can difference them from jugling Charms, They are uſeleſs, unworthy God, and worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to all rational men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The reaſon hereof given in another Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe<note place="margin">Proteſt. without Princi. Diſc. 1. c. 8.</note> was much to this Sence. God by working Miracles in behalfe of true Religion engages (as it were) in à Diſpute againſt the Divel and all Adverſaries that oppoſe it, and after ſuch an Engagement, cannot but Convince and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer by the ſtrength of rational Motives, but his own Miracles juſtly and chiefly numbred among theſe Perfwaſive Motives, are upon that Account known and made diſcernable from all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96808:55"/> Falſe and fallacious Signs. Hence I alſo ſaid,<note place="margin">No falſe Sect can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſurpaſſe or match the true Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves.</note> that no falſe Sect can either ſurpaſſe true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the Evidence of rational Motives, or ſo much as match it in the luſtre of Signal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. For had à falſe Religion more glorious Miracles wrought in it (or the like equal Signs all things conſidered) God would not only <hi>Stand guilty of arguing leſſe efficaciouſly for his own Verities,</hi> but natural Reaſon alſo would be left in à ſtate of Indifferency, no more determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to embrace what is true, than falſe. And thus you ſe, if true Miracles ever more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly ſet forth true Religion (and cannot with the like ſplendor belong to any falſe Sect) They are upon that Account diſtinguished from the Legerdemain and all illuſive Signs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Pretenders to Truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I hold it here time loſt to inſiſt long upon the pretended Miracles done by Heathens and Hereticks, you shall not produce one wrought by them (as Infidels and Hereticks) that goes beyond à Legerdemain trick, an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Conjures jugling, or at moſt what Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits can do <hi>by natural Cauſes.</hi> Wherefore S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin<note place="margin">Medina de rectâ in Deum fide lib. 2. p. 65.</note> cited by Michael Medina expreſly tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that neither men nor Divels can by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Magick effect any other thing, <hi>Quam id quod antea in utero naturae per Seminales rationes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lituit,</hi> than that only which before lay as it were hid in the wombe of nature. Now as God limit's theſe Evil Spirits, ſo in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſtint's the Power of Infidels and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; <hi>when aſsiſted by Divels</hi> they show won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Again examin rigidly the Authority al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for theſe Signs, you will find nothing beſides <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Single Writer, who talk's
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96808:55"/> upon bare Hear ſay only, which is far different<note place="margin">No Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the pretended wonders of Heathens.</note> from our Proceeding, for we allow no Miracles but ſuch as have been atteſted by the Solemn Oaths of Ey-witneſſes, and made good upon all other Proofs poſſible for mankind to require in à matter of greateſt Conſequence. Obſerve well the Compariſon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Miracles wrought in the Church (as we have already proved, and shall hereafter demonſtrate) have been innumerable, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended wonders of Heathens and Hereticks qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te contrary, penurious and very few. The firſt wrought by men of eminent Virtue, and members of that Holy Society which God in all Ages has illuſtrated with Miracles, have gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned renown over all the world: Thoſe other dull Works (if yet ever done) had their being either from no Chriſtians, or very bad ones, and to this day lie buried in Obſcurity.

The other mean and Slender are not (when true) above the Power of inviſible Spirits. The Firſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidly examined we find, as I ſaid, upon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Faith moſt certain, Thoſe other done by Infidels and Hereticks without Oath or Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination are not only doubtful, but Judged by grave Authors, <hi>falſe, Counterfeit,</hi> or at the<note place="margin">S.

I ſay therefore the Miracles of Chriſt our Lord, of the Apoſtles, and all thoſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>wrought amongſt God's People,</hi> or in the<note place="margin">Now true Miracles are diſtinguished from falſe wonders.</note> Church (Theſe I alwaies joyn together) are eaſily diſtinguished from the ſlight Signs of Heathens and Hereticks? Firſt by their Strength, or powerful virtue manifeſt to all unbyaſſed Judgements. 2. By their vaſt Number and incomparable Greatneſs. 3. By the Quality of the Perſons that did them. 4. By the End for which they were wrought. All and every one of theſe diſtinctive Marks, the Signal great Miracles wrought by Chriſt, the Apoſtles, and in the Church, ever had and will have; And I chiefly ſpeak here of great Miracles.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Call now to mind all the Wonders do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, or thought to be done by Heathens, lay by them the Donatiſt's Dreams and Viſions (ſuſpected, ſaith S. Auguſtin, of fraud even<note place="margin">Aug. de unit. Eccl. cap. 19.</note> by the moſt prudent and Judicious.) Grant (which many think falſe) that the Novatians had ſome ſlender Miracles among them. Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96808:56"/> up, <hi>I ſay,</hi> Theſe and many more like<note place="margin">Greater Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought by two Saints. than by All Heathens and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</note> them, what have we but the loweſt ſort of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Imaginable, for none ſurmount's the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of good, or Evil Spirits. I dare boldly avouch, that only two bleſſed men S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Cantilupe, and S. Francis Xaverius, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve by Gods aſſiſtance wrought not only more, but far greater Miracles, than all the Heathens and Hereticks that lived ſince the creation of the world, were all true that's Written of them, whereas God knowes, more than the halfe is falſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Look on the Condition of Perſons among Heathens and Hereticks that pretend to Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, you find them all ſuſpected, and of little Credit. Infidels knew not Chriſt, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks like shameleſſe Fugitives deſerted his Church. If Therefore ſuch wicked men do any thing like à Miracle, it is done as S. Auſtin prudently Obſerves, <hi>per Signa publicae Iuſtitiae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 83. Queſt. 78. &amp; 79.</note> that is illegally, or by no Lawful but à uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Power, as wrought by them. So naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Souldiers do, ſaith the Saint, when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Military Diſcipline they extort from honeſt men what is Publickly forbidden. On the other Side the Juſt endued with ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Faith work Miracles by lawful Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which God's Divine Juſtice approves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as thoſe others were out of Chriſt's Church, ſo theſe are profeſſed members of it; See S.<note place="margin">Petra San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta volum. 1 prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gom. p. 27.</note> Auſtins Quotations further enlarged by Petra Sancta, and Judge whether God's Servants that truly doe Miracles, are not very different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualifyed from others caſt out of the houſe of God.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The end of Miracles ever intended for
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96808:57"/> the Good of others, is chiefly to ſtrengthen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faith and encreaſe Charity, whence it is, that S. Gregory the Great, writing to S. Auguſtin<note place="margin">S Greg. lib 9. Epiſt. 58.</note> our Apoſtle of England, gives this prudent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition. <hi>For as much as concern's the working of Miracles, know that whatever gift you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in this kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is freely</hi> beſtowed on you for the Good and Saluation <hi>of thoſe ſouls committed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">For what End Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are wrought.</note> 
                  <hi>to your Charge.</hi> To this end all our Saviours Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and thoſe likewiſe wrought in the Church were ever, and are ſtill chiefly directed. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe, Thoſe ſuppoſed Wonders done by Heathens, were moſt for à <hi>Show only or Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> without benefit to ſoul or Body; for what good could the walking of dull Images up and down, or the cutting of à wherſtone in two produce in any? Neither can Miracles, as do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne by Hereticks (if yet ever wrought) avail one Whit for the encreaſe of Faith or Charity, for how can men that have made Shipwrack of Faith and torn Charity in pieces by Separating themſelves from Chriſt and his Church, help to perfect theſe Virtues in others? <hi>I ſay, as do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne by Hereticks,</hi> for if any good enſues when ſo wrought, That' <hi>meerly Accidental,</hi> and cannot be aſcribed to the Hereticks Faith, or any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Now we Argue further, and show by the real Effects which true Miracles have wrought,<note place="margin">John. 15. v. 2. 4.</note> their worth and viſible Difference from thoſe other diſpirited dead Signs done by Heathens and Hereticks. For the Readers better Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I here make uſe of our Saviours Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Argument againſt the Iewes, whom he told <hi>If he had not done greater works among them, than any other, they had been without ſin excuſable, but
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96808:57"/> now having ſeen his Miracles, and after all to hate</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Miracles proved by real effects.</note> 
                  <hi>him and his Father, no Excuſe could be made.</hi> Pray, Ponder ſeriouſly. The Iewes had once great Miracles among them wrought by Moſes and the Prophets, yet our Saviour plainly Aſſert's, he had then done greater, (and theſe words I conceive were ſpoken before the Miracles shown at his ſacred Paſſion, and Reſurrection.) Is it true, had he then done greater than Moſes and the Prophets? Far greater Therefore we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re they, by much did they Surpaſſe in true weight and value all the pretended Wonders of Heathens then living or that afterwards should appear in the world. This our Saviour Aſſert's or nothing.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Some Iew or Infidel may reply. Chriſt ſaid here much of his Miracles, but how prove we that he ſpake Truth? I anſwer, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve this manifeſtly, by Arguing <hi>from known Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to the cauſe,</hi> that is, we evince the Cauſe, (Chriſt's Miracles I mean) to be more vigorous, Strong and attractive than all others, by thoſe real Admirable effects (palpable to all Eyes) which enſued upon their being wrought by the Son of God. Caſt therefore your Eyes upon the known Converſions made by Chriſt and his Miniſters the bleſſed Apoſtles, look alſo<note place="margin">What theſe admirable effects are?</note> upon the large encreaſe and ſtrange Growth of the Militant Church, during the firſt Age of Chriſtianity call to mind the Ruin and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Idols (Signal Effects of the primitive Miracles) and you will find by theſe and the like innumerable Wonders, that the Miracles then done (never exhibited to be gazed on) had Influence upon all. Could ever yet Heathen or Heretick show you the like Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96808:58"/> Works following the Wonders they bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſt of?</p>
               <p n="12">12. Hence we proceed to Miracles wrought in the Catholick Church and show alſo by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny real Effects their Worth to be far above all the pretended Wonders done by Infidels and Hereticks. Tell me, did ever any of theſe (or all together) show you by Virtue of their Signs ſuch à united Society of men in one Faith, as our Church showes? Did ever any faſt,<note place="margin">Effects real and palpable prove the Churches Miracles.</note> pray, and curb their Paſſions like thoſe in this Chriſtian Society? Did ever any show the like Contempt of the world their whole life long, as thouſands and thouſands have done amongſt us? No God knowes, ſo many noble Heroick Actions fruits of Divine Grace, and known Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles (Grace working inwardly Miracles more outwardly) were never ſeen or heard of with the like Perſeverance and conſtancy in any other So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, but in the Roman Catholick Church on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Moſt reaſonably Therefore may we apply our Saviours ſacred Words to this Church, and ſay. <hi>Had She not done greater Works, had She not exhibited more glorious Miracles in the Open view of the world than any other, thoſe rebellious Spirits that oppoſe Her, would not have committed ſo hainous à ſin, but having ſeen the palpable VVonders wrought in Her and by her, their ſin is, ſupra modum pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> enormouſly great, and unexcuſable.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Thus much ſaid of true Miracles, I would willingly know to what purpoſe doth Dr Still. produce the Wonders of Infidels and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks againſt the great Works of God Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in our Church? Can he hope by theſe leſſer Signs to extinguish the Light of great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles? Or will he ſuppoſe the Heathens Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96808:58"/> true and ours falſe? If ſo; he is above meaſure blamable, unleſſe he firſt prove their Records Authentick, and ours forged? Will he ſay that all the Miracles pretended by Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils, Hereticks, and the Church, are à like falſe and feigned? He Speaks at random without proofe, and dos open wrong to <hi>Manifeſt Truth.</hi> You will better underſtand what I would<note place="margin">An Inſtance Shewing that no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon can be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Churches Mirucles, and thoſe done by Infidels.</note> Say by this one clear Example. Imagin it we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re certainly known to us all, that it pleaſes Almighty God for the ending of debates ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Religion, to have matters decided by à vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſight of Miracles in an open Conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two men. Suppoſe likewiſe that God should ſay theſe men shall appear among you to Morrow: The one à falſe Prophet, à great Magician, The other my Servant commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to work in my name, but none before hand shall diſtinguish between them, ſave only by the Strength and greatneſſe of their Signs. U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon theſe make your Judgement. The one having without violence ſet open à priſon Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te faſt shut endeavours to reſuſcitate à man ſtark dead, but cannot, The other by à Word on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken? recal's him to life. The one after he had shown an Image walking up and down, Offers to cure the born blind, <hi>but in vain.</hi> The other preſently gives him perfect ſight, and thus the Strife goes on in exhibiting many like Wonders. Is it not, think ye, as eaſy to diſtinguish the Magacian from the other in this conteſt, as is to diſcern between à Blazing ſtar and à glorious Sun? The very like is our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe in the Compariſon made between Miracles wrought in the Church, and thoſe other done by Infidels and Hereticks, when Divels have à hand in them.</p>

In the mean while.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. I ſay firſt.

The reaſon given abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, is clear. The firſt Verity cannot contradict himſelfe, but God would Do ſo could he by clear Signs eſtablish à Doctrin Contrary to his own known and received Truths, if, as we now ſuppoſe, he ſpeak's as well by Signs as
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96808:59"/> by words. Hence it alſo followes that in caſe he permit à Miracle to be done by any out of the Church, as was by Balaams Aſſe (no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I hope of the true Church) that ever yeild's in worth and Greatneſſe to his own glorious Miracles.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. I ſay. 2. The Divel that brought in<note place="margin">The Divels Power in doing won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> this Confuſion of Signs between falſe and true Miracles, and would fain do ſomething like God, can work no wonder but either by daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mans fancy, or by à ſwift and ſubtle Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of natural Agents together in order to ſome unuſual effect, as is already noted. All true eſſential Tranſmutations therefore, All Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of perfect living Creatures, as of men, horſes, and the like, not ſubject to any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, are above the Divels Power, hence ſaith Medina cited above, what ſome Write of men changed into Wolves, is to be accounted feigned and fabulous.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96808:60"/> point's at theſe Signs, as <hi>bringing down fire from Heaven,</hi> and ſeducing the Inhabitants on the earth.

By theſe few and the very like few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances taken from Scripture the Reader may diſcover à vaſt diſparity, between Miracles done by wicked men and thoſe others far more Numerous wrought by Chriſt, and in the Church. Lay them together, you will find, no compariſon at all, ſo true it is, that Miracles wrought by faith and faithful men, ever carry with them more ſtrength, à greater VVorth and value. If you ask why then doth not God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies make uſe of theſe Inſtruments to show his Power by, with excluſion of Sinners from this Favour? I Anſwer, this is to teach us, that Miracles derive not their worth from the weak Inſtruments whereby they are done, but from God the Principal cauſe, that does them.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96808:63"/> Now should they alwaies <hi>and only be</hi> wrought by holy men, ſome leſſe Conſiderate might miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,<note place="margin">lib. 83. quaeſt. 79.</note> and aſcribe them to the merit or Sanctity of him that does them, which is an Errour, for <hi>Gratiae gratis datae,</hi> are Gods free Gifts, not ever imparted to the moſt holy and virtuous.

                  <p n="30">30. Yet ſome perhaps may think, the glory of Miracles much leſſened, if done by Infidels and wicked men. I anſwer not one whit, when as I ſaid, they are but few, and not comparable either in worth or greatnes to thoſe innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Miracles, which have been wrought by men famous for vertue and Sanctity. Suppoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that Veſpaſian the Emperour, as Sueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Writes, cured the blind and lame, That one Wonder is not comparable to the many blind and lame cured by bleſſed S.

Of pretended Miracles done by Hereticks we shall ſpeak more hereafter. I never yet read any worth the ſcratch of à pen, the leaſt Notice, or Refutation. Or if Miracles be ſuppoſed frequent among Hereticks, how fall's it out, that our Modern Sectaries work none at all?</p>
                  <p n="31">31. Others Say, if wicked men by God's<note place="margin">Miracles wrought by wicked men nothing leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibily of the Churches Doctrine.</note> permiſſion and Power work Miracles, How can we prove Chriſt's and the Churches Doctrin Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible by an Argument taken from Miracles? I Anſwer very eaſily. 1. Becauſe all done by wicked men (when God concurr's) tend, as I ſaid at laſt, to the Glory of Chriſt and his Church. 2. Such Miracles are but few, Chriſt's Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and the Churches many, great and moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious. From theſe we Argue, and show how Powerful they have been by their admirable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, manifeſt in the converſion of whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Chriſt and his Church, And hence <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally</hi> conclude with Richardus de S. Victore, that à Doctrin propagated by the Luſtre of ſo many known Signs cannot but be from God, and Conſequently true.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. Though therefore this Inference be Null; <hi>One work's à Miracle, Ergo his Doctrin is true,</hi> yet this other way of Arguing convinces. <hi>I ſee à whole ample Society of Chriſtians, conſtantly priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Age after Age with the Grace of working innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble great Miracles,</hi> in ſo much that the Power granted ſeem's in à manner, Ordinary, This Inference <hi>I ſay</hi> hold's good. <hi>The Doctrin taught by that Society is from God and ſound.</hi> Thus we
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96808:64" rendition="simple:additions"/> was never yet, nor will be permitted, becauſe rationally Argue for the Truth of Apoſtolical Doctrin and the Churches alſo, and further evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, that no Society of men ſince Chriſt's time, whether Heathens, Iewes, Hereticks, wicked, or ſmooth Pretenders to Piety, hath been in any low Degree (much leſſe conſtantly) favovred, with the like Grace in working Miracles as our one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Roman Church, Therefore, her Doctrin is from God and Orthodox.<note place="margin">Wonders do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne by the Divel are no Miracles.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="33">33. By what is hitherto ſaid, you may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguish three ſorts of Miracles. Thoſe done by the Divel as the Principal Agent (ever of the meaneſt rank) <hi>are not properly Miracles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they Surmount not ſome hidden virtue contained in natural cauſes, and ſuch, by the Divels malice or his Inſtruments, may be ſaid to prove à falſe Doctrin, contrary to Chriſt. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe other which God wrought by Balaam and impious men, were true Miracles, and can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be intended for à proof of falſe Doctrin, nor perverted to à ſiniſter End. The Third ſort wrought by Chriſt, the Apoſtles, and the Church have upon à double account an incomparable Value. Firſt they depend on God as the ſole Principal cauſe, and ſecondly proceed <hi>Ex fide,</hi> being ever done by Perſons endued with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Faith, and for the moſt part, very Holy and Vertuous.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. Here upon we briefly ſolve one diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty which may occurr. If falſe Prophets like Balaam, impowred by Almighty God, can Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy or caſt out Divels, why may they not alſo raiſe the dead, convert nations, reſtore ſight to the<note place="margin">One difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſolved.</note> blind and do all the other Miracles which Chriſt and his Apoſtles wrought? I Anſwer all this, if
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96808:64"/> Providence, to ſet forth the worth of Faith and to honour the faithful in his Church, will have their Miracles <hi>great, glorious, and many,</hi> Thoſe wrought by faithleſſe and impious very few, and of leſſe Account. Perhaps the four or five already mentioned and regiſtred in Holy Writ, are the very moſt (or rather all) that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve been wrought ſince Chriſtianity began, and therefore prove not, that the like Shall be done in future Ages.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Having hitherto ſpoken of many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Miracles, and further declared, how they differ from Antichriſt's Signs and all ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonders, I might here fitly bring in Dr Still. weak Objections, and alſo inſiſt upon his ſtrange Anſwers, returned to two or three great Miracles, clearly ſet down in another Treatiſe, But becauſe the Gentleman moſt buſies himſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe about theſe matters, towards the end of his <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,</hi> we shall, God willing, meet with him there, and in the mean time (to make innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable moſt glorious Miracles better known) will condeſcend to his humour, and follow him as he lead's us on in his other Pilgrimages to <hi>Compoſtella, S.

If I make this out in the enſuing Diſcourſe, Dr Stillingfleet will have little cauſe to glory in his empty Pamphlet; if I do not, Let all

               <p n="1">1. TWo things may be controverted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning S. James the Son of Zebedee, and Brother to S. John the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt. The one, whether he ever preached in Spain, and this Cardinal Baronius ſeem's leſſe<note place="margin">Baronius Tom. 9. Antwerp. print. ad ann. 816.

                  </note> to show, both becauſe the body of S.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96808:65"/> herein he fail'd, and gave no Satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proof in that great Council.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing called into doubt by Dr Still. is the Tranſlation of this great Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les venerable Body to Compoſtella, which happened that very year he was beheaded by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod at Hieruſalem. For this you have an Epiſtle<note place="margin">Num. 71.</note> of Pope Leo the third Cited by Baronius, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re it is ſaid, that the dead body being thrown out to doggs and ravenous fowle, was Put into à Ship carried firſt to <hi>Iria Flavia,</hi> and thence to Compoſtella. The manner of its Tranſlation I have now by me, which is taken out of an ancient M. S. Cited afterwards; The ſubſtance wherof is as followes. When the Holy Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les according to the Command of our Bleſſed Saviour reſolved to Preach the Sacred Goſpel to an unbelieving world, they made choice of S. Teſyphon, ordained him Bishop, and ſent him with other aſſociated Bishops to Preach in Spain, then wholly Heathenish and Idolatrous. Theſe God inſpired to take along with them the<note place="margin">The marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Body caſt into à ſmall Veſſel, Came ſafe to the Frontirs of Galicia.</note> martyred Body of S. James, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently placed in à ſmall Veſſel, and more by the guidance of Divine Providence, than by the help of any Pilote ſafely arrived in the laſt Frontires of Gallicia, where then à great Lady called <hi>Luparia</hi> Lived. To her theſe wearied Paſſengers addreſſed themſelves, and earneſtly begged to have à Plat of ground allotted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re they might decently bury the Apoſtles Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, But She, ſaith my Relation, ſavage and barbarous, in diriſion fent them to à Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain called then <hi>Illicinus,</hi> where à number of wild Oxen ran up and down; Goe, ſaid the Lady, and take of theſe as many as you can, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96808:66"/> then bury your Apoſtle. When the Servants of God drew neer the wild beaſts their fiereneſſe ceaſed, and they became gentle like Lambs, much after that manner as S. Ambroſe in his Haexameron recount's of thoſe beaſts that were deſigned to devour S. Tecla.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Upon this Sight and another wonder which S. Teſyphon wrought in deſtroying à Cruel Dragon that ravaged there about, by making only the Sign of the Croſſe, the Lady <hi>Luparia,</hi> or Lupa was converted to Chriſt, and turned Her Palace into à Church. Dr Still. cites Joan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<note place="margin">Dr Sill. pag. 470.</note> Beleth à learned man and Dr of Sorbon in confirmation of this Story concerning Lupa, and when he has done, <hi>as his fashion is,</hi> refutes it very learnedly, by à ſimple Demand. <hi>Is not this à Miracle as great and as well atteſted, as any wrought by Chriſt and his Apoſtles?</hi> Good Mr Dr. though we are far from judging either this or any other like Story, to be as well atteſted as Miracles in Holy Writ, yet by your leave, we may diſcourſe and conclude, I think, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grounded Principles, that all ſuch Stories deſerve not contempt. Pray, Sr, reflect, we have in Scripture, that Chriſt our Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Apoſtles to ſpread his Holy Goſpel<note place="margin">Mark 16. v. 20.</note> the whole world over, we have that they did ſo, we have upon Known Hiſtory that ſome prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the Indies, others in England, others in different Parts of the Univerſe, and made great converſions juſtly accounted Miraculous. VVe next enquire, how or by what meanes theſe great Miſſioneries got into ſo remote places? Do<note place="margin">Dr Still. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes the Story by Laughing at it.</note> not you think Mr Dr, were all particulars known that we should diſcover many great favours Shown thoſe bleſſed men in their Travels, which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96808:66"/> might juſtly ſeem extraordinary, and Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous? Here Sr, you have one ſtrange Paſſage related of S. Teſyphon and his Aſſociates who tranſported the Holy Body of S. James to Spain, Can you perſwade your ſelfe, that to laugh at the Story, as you doe, is à weighty refutation, though all this while I propoſe it not as Goſpel? What I find beſides in this Relation, is that S. James's Body was buried neer to the Mountain <hi>Illicinus,</hi> now called <hi>Mons Sacer,</hi> not far from à Fountain and there left by thoſe Holy men, who carried it thither.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thus much ſaid, we return to Baronius<note place="margin">Num. 71.</note> where we are told, that by reaſon of the great perſecution raiſed againſt Chriſtians in thoſe parts of Spain (All long ſince dead, who Conveyed the Sacred Body thither) the Sepulchre likewi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe where the Treaſure lay being hid, and all the Memory of it, forgotten, Behold, ſaith Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,<note place="margin">Num. 72.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96808:67"/> with the ſingular Grace of innumerable ſtupendious Miracles, And theſe great Works of Divine Power as Baronius notes well, are better proofs than all that can be Written.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now comes Dr Still. with à ſimple Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. <hi>You have,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>à Body buried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thorns and Bushes,</hi> What then? <hi>muſt this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout any Inſcription or Characters upon it, needs be S.

Pray you tell me, had the other Apoſtles when they preached to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Countries carried this or the like Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon their Breaſts. <hi>VVe are Apoſtles of</hi> JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST, <hi>and done no Miracles,</hi> or wrought Miracles, as they did, without ſuch Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Tell me I ſay, whether of theſe two, think you, would have drawn Infidels ſooner to the Beliefe of JESUS CHRIST? I hold God's own Characters far more prevalent, and ſo they are in our preſent caſe. O! but we yet prove not that it was S. James his Body, why may it not be the Body of ſome other? I Anſwer firſt, it is à Body whereby God is pleaſed to work pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Miracles evidently ſeen by innumerable Eye-witneſſes, and Miracles are the Scar-Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes our Dr fear's moſt, whether done by S. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes or any other makes nothing for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Again, ſuppoſing the Evidence of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought at Compoſtella, which is undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, why should we not rather aſcribe them to the Power of God working by the Apoſtles Body, than to any other unknown Saint that may perhaps Lie interred thereabout.

The Dr relates part of it, and after his manner jeer's at all. Briefly the Story is thus. After S. James had viſited Judea and Samaria, and proved by Scripture in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Synagogues that JESUS CHRIST is the true Son of God, Hermogenes à Magician ſent his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Hermogenes and Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> Philetus to the Apoſtle, who told him that his Maſter Hermogenes could enervate all he had ſaid of Chriſt, But Philetus ſeing the ſtrange Miracles S. James had done in reſtoring ſight to the blind, and cleanſing the Lepers, and hearing alſo of his raiſing the dead, upon his return told Hermogenes what he had heard and ſeen, and that now he reſolved to be one of S. James Diſciples, whereat the Magician highly enraged, commanded the Divels to bind Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ſo faſt that he could not ſtir, But the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le who ſent his handkerchief to Philetus ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed him, and enjoyned the Divels to bring Hermogenes without hurt faſt bound to him. This done, Hermogenes clearly ſeing the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Power of God working with S. James, much humbled and confounded, became Poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. <hi>Accipe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Poenitentem quem invidentem &amp; detrahentem hactenus ſuſtinuiſti.</hi> Accept of me, great Apoſtle, whom you have hitherto patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly borne with as à moſt ſpiteful and unworthy Detractor. If replyed S. James, thou be truly poenitent burn all thy books of Magick, Go from houſe to houſe, where thou haſt wrought miſchiefe, and recall all thou haſt done, reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the money unjuſtly got by thy Charms, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96808:68"/> JESUS CHRIST, ſeek to pleaſe him whom thou wilt find merciful, if thou ceaſeſt not to be faithful in his Service. Hermogenes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed embraced theſe wholſome Admonitions, and Promiſed to comply with every one moſt faithfully, then falling down at the Apoſtles feet, <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>the wrath of the Divels will tear me in pieces, unleſſe you give me ſomething to</hi>

                  <hi>ſecure me from their rage.</hi> Take this my walking Staffe replyed S. James, and no Divel shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy thee. Much more followes of Hermogenes his working Miracles with the Apoſtles Staffe, of his Zeal in preaching JESUS Chriſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt out of the old Teſtament to be the true Son of God, the long expected <hi>Meſsias,</hi> and converting many to the true Faith. Some dayes after theſe great Converſions wrought, Abiathar the Prieſt of that year Seditiouſly raiſed à ſtorm of perſecution againſt S. James, who violently haled to Herode the Son of Archelaus, was by his command beheaded.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Will you briefly hear what Sport our Dr makes with this Relation? Firſt ſaith he. <hi>You muſt never ask from whence they had it, it is fully enough, that the name of Hermogenes and Philetus are in the new Teſtament.</hi> I anſwer, the Dr had more for the ſmall parcel he relates than theſe two <hi>bare names</hi> ſet down in Scripture, otherwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe he will be thought the firſt Contriver of it. In à word, the Story is collected out of ſo many <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> diſperſed up and down ſeveral parts in Europe, that unleſſe you ſay all conſpired to regiſter à Fable you ought upon <hi>humane</hi>

An Extract or collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all theſe and many other particulars ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by two worthy Judicious men about 14. years Since, I have now on the Table where I write, and hope this comes to more than à proof taken from the two names of <hi>Hermogenes and Philetus</hi> recorded in the new Teſtament.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Dr's Objections propoſed againſt this Story are ſo profoundly ſimple, that they deſerve nothing but contempt. One is, the mention made of Hermogenes in the preſent Roman Breviary ſeem's very lean and bare. That is, he would have had the fifth Leſſon there enlarged, which ſome, who are obliged to their Canonical houres might perhaps have thought too long, and well content themſelves with the ſubſtance of the Story there expreſſed. Viz. <hi>S. Iames returned to Hieruſalem, when among</hi>

                  <hi>others he had inſtructed Hermogenes à Magician in the Truth of Chriſtian Faith</hi> &amp;c. Another Objection takes all its force from the Dr<hi rend="sup">s</hi> memory who, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, remembers no Abiathar high Prieſt ſince the Dayes of King Solomon. Had he had but à ſmal portion of Solomons wiſdom he might have reflected, that many things are now out of his remembrance which were once in it, and far more there are, which never got thither. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Abiathar was in Solomons time, and why might not there be another in Herodes dayes? The Relation expreſly ſaies it, and That's enough for me. I ſaid juſt now, that the Apoſtle to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Hermogenes from the rage of Divels lent him his walking ſtaff. <hi>Is not this</hi> ſaith our Dr
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96808:69"/> (very wiſely) <hi>like one of the Apoſtles Miracles to give men Inſtruments for the cudgelling of Divels?</hi> Pray, Sr, tell me, when à Saint, as Eliſeus the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was, gave his ſtaff to Giezi, did that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily imply any Cudgelling Buſineſſe?

In fine, upon examination it was found in the Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantue belonging to à Father and his Son.

At which time<note place="margin">Heros quidam.</note> à certain Gentleman much affrighted with the mortality, purpoſed to make à Pilgrimage to S.

Thus the Dr.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Shall we perfect the Dr's short Story à<note place="margin">Quidam nauta.</note> little. Both theſe Miracles Pope Calixtus relates; The firſt happened Anno 1191. to à Mariner by name <hi>Friſon,</hi> who with his Ship full of Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers went to viſit the Holy Sepulchre at Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and was ſet upon by à Sarracen called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit Mainon,</hi> that endeavouvred to make him and all the Chriſtians Captives. While the Sarracens and Chriſtians were cloſe together hard at Fight, Friſon the Capitain laden with à Coat of Mail, à Helmet, and à Buckler by chance ſlip't between the Veſſels, into the VVater when in his heart he called upon S. James, and implored the Apoſtles Aſſiſtance for himſelfe and fellow Chriſtians. S. James appearing took him by the hand, ſafely placed him in his own Ship, and to the great Terror of the Sarracens conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Chriſtians ſafe to the End of their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge. The other Miracle concerning the pious Pilgrim that returned from Hieruſalem happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Anno 1104. who caſually thrown into the deep ſea, forthwith called on S. James for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:96808:72"/> when behold, another of his companions caſt his Buckler after him, and cryed out, <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious S.

S. James took him by the crown of his head, followed the ship through the water three whole dayes, and brought him ſafe to the long wished for Haven. <hi>A Domino factum eſt iſtud, &amp; eſt mirabile in oculis noſtris.</hi> Thus my Manuſcript.</p>
               <p n="22">22. All the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> replies, is ſoon ended. <hi>Theſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>were pretty odd things done at ſea.</hi> As odd as they are, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, prove you the fraud or grant the Facts. Next he demands? <hi>What shall we think of S. Iames making à man to leap from à Tower fourty cubits high, without any hurt?</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, I hold it à great Miracle, and Ask what you have againſt it? To make it greater, my Book tell's me the Tower was three ſcore cubits high, and the Story is thus related by Pope Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixtus. Anno 1105. One called Bernard, kept cloſe Priſoner in à Caſtle of Italy was faſt bound<note place="margin">Two great Miraclrs wrought by S. Iames.</note> with chains under ground. Night and day the afflicted Perſon prayed to S. James for his freedom. The Apoſtle appearing graciouſly heard his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, looſened his fetters, and ſaid; <hi>Come and follow me to Gallicia.</hi> Preſently the impriſoned man went up to the higheſt part of the Caſtle, and by one leap eſcaped without hurt at all. Yet the Dr has not done, but ask's what we shall ſay to à more <hi>Courteous Miracle of à high Tower ſtooping to the ground?</hi> Anſwer, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dr, was not the ſtanding of the Sun in Joſues time à more <hi>courteous Miracle,</hi> than the ſtooping of this Tower? Or did Holy Joſeph except againſt the Viſion he had of the Sun, Moon, and ſtars
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96808:73"/> bowing to him, for their being over Courteous? What à ſtrange Humour is this, Our Dr will have Miracles related, and when that's done, nothing contents him unleſſe that <hi>be taken away which makes them Miracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. In à word. This Miracle of à Tower ſtooping Writen by Pope Calixtus concerned à Merchand, who fraudulently cheated of his Goods by à great Perſon, was injuriouſly caſt into Priſon. In this ſad condition he addreſſed himſelfe to S. James by earneſt prayer; The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle appearing to the Priſoner while his Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were awake, commanded him to go up to the height of à Tower which bowed ſo low that the top of it <hi>ſeemed</hi> to reach the ground, and the man went off without hurt or danger. The chains wherewith the Priſoner was bound, are kept to this day in the Church of Gallicia, as à Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Miracle.</p>
               <p n="24">24. The laſt Miracle the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> jeers at, is of à Country man in Spain that preſumed to Thresh on S. James's Feaſt, and going into à Bath at night, the Skin of his back from the Shoulders to his Leggs (à Punishment for profaning that Day) ſtuck to the wall of the Bath whereupon he dyed. The Miracle is taken out of à Book kept in the famous Monaſtery of S. Victor in France n. 287.

                  <p n="19">19. S. Athanaſius cited in the 2.

I wonder the Dr makes uſe of theſe words, becauſe as Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, they neceſſarily prove the Blood in the Bleſſed Sacrament to be truly and really Chriſt's Sacred Blood, For if none really remain on earth but that in the Holy Euchariſt, that moſt certainly is Suppoſed to be the true real Blood of our Saviour; So if any truly ſay, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne is in the houſe but <hi>Peter,</hi> the Aſſertion neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily implies Peter to be there.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96808:85"/> of Charles the Great to Mantua, with Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be informed of the Truth, as likewiſe of the Miracles wrought there by Virtue of that precious Treaſure, where the Pope receiving full Satisfaction, approved all by à ſpecial Bull as Baronius cited by Bellar. witneſſes.

Our Catholick Bishops then prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in their ſeveral Diſtricts, highly eſteemed the Gift, and shewed of what worth it was, with much Zeal and fervour.</p>
                  <p n="20">20.

                  <p n="21">21. A third Objection. <hi>All the Blood of our Saviour Shed in his Sacred Paſsion vvas as many hold,</hi> reaſſumed at his Reſurrection, Anſwerable to an old Maxim. <hi>Quod ſemel aſſumpſit non demiſit.</hi> The D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> to his shame blindly ſtumbles upon the Difficulty, after he had (as it ſeem's) read Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus his clear Solutions, but was willing to<note place="margin">Ferran. ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſect. 7.</note> conceal what he would not have à Reader know. Briefly; None Saith Ferrandus, can Aſſert that our Saviour reaſſumed all the Parts of matter added to his Sacred Body by continual Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without making it of à monſtrous Bigneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, yet thoſe particles once were united to his Divine Perſon, though never reaſſumed, Why Therefore may we not Say, that as our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer left on the one ſide great Quantity of his Blood as à Teſtimony of his dear Affection to Mortals, who reverently preſerve it; ſo on the other, when he roſe from death He reſumed ſo much Vital Blood (perhaps, ſaith Ferrandus, taken from ſome other matter) as was ſufficient to conſtitute his Glorious Body in à perfect Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of Immortality. Again, were it needful, Why might we not aſſert, that, that copious torrent<note place="margin">The Dr may think this Doctrin Strange But that's no matter. Let him read Divines.</note> of Blood which fell from Chriſt in his bitter Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, remain's yet Hypoſtatically <hi>Vnited to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſon?</hi> His dead Body lying in the Grave retained ſtill, (all confeſs) the Hypoſtatical union, and ſo did his glorious Soul in Lymbo, Though all that time far diſtant from the Body.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96808:86"/> In like manner, that precious Blood which plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully gushed out of his Veins, may, to verify that Maximin both be reaſſumed, and yet ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main on earth in Mantua, in S. Maximins Church with the Xantons alſo, and ſome other Parts of Europe. And thus the Divine Blood now shut up in our Saviours Body in Heaven And here on earth in the Bleſſed Sacrament, may without Prejudice <hi>to Faith,</hi> be thought Individually the very ſame, yea (and were this certainly known) adored likewiſe with Latria, or Divine worship. I am Sure the Doctrin is held ſound by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Gregory de Valencia, and maintained by many other great Divines.</p>

The work would be long for my short Diſcourſe to name other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes recounted by Denys upon this matter, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe yet to know, that Clement the VII. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Marſeils, would not return to Italy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had done his Devotion to S.

Now if ſo many Popes have both reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced and approved theſe Reliques you muſt either rashly impeach them of Overſight and knavery in their approving Fables for Truths, or ought prudently to acquieſce in their Judgement with the reſt of the Chriſtian world.</p>

Mary Magdalen's arrival at Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence, is taken out of à fabulous Book com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in Hebrew by S. Marcella, Servant to S.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:96808:93"/> not older. Monſieur Denys Anſwer's, ſome ſtrange Phrenſy ſeiz'd on Launoy in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, For in another place he grant's, that Book to have been extant twelve whole Ages paſt, though neither <hi>here</hi> nor <hi>there,</hi> he brings Proof, Author, or Witneſs for any thing he Saith, but his own bare and proofleſs Word. In the ſame place, Monſieur Denys Showes, we rely not only upon thoſe Acts of S. Marcella, having other both grave and Ancient Authors that Write of this Subject, and recount many Particulars not expreſſed in Marcella's Acts. Monſieur Launoy Objects 3. The Tradition of the Greek and Latin Church, whereby it appears, that S.

In à word, ſaith Denys, <hi>non erant convenientia Teſtintonia eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and therefore worth nothing.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. I Stand aſtonished at the Spite and Enuy of our unconſcionable D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, who could not but know before he put pen to paper, the great Wonders Authors of unſpotted fame have recorded of theſe two glorious Saints. He could not but know in what Strange manner Divine Providence Propagated the two Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders founded by S. Dominick and S. Francis, and this without the help of Arms, humane En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements, or any earthly commodity. The Propagation of Chriſtian Religion gained much in the minds of men, by it's ſpreading over all Nations, and upon that Account was deemed by the great S. Auſtin, Miraculous, And shall we<note place="margin">S. Auſtin lik. 22. de civit. cap. 5.</note> think the large ſtreaming out of Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, viſibly before our eyes, altogether deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Divine Aſſiſtance? The D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> could not but know, if ever he peruſed Hiſtory, how many painful Miſſioners have been ſent out of theſe Religious Orders into ſeveral parts of the world for the Converſion of Iewes, and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, as alſo of the happie ſucceſs they had in drawing innumerable Souls from Infidelity to the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity. Finally he could
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96808:94" rendition="simple:additions"/> not but know, that never Proteſtants (to their Shame be it) did any thinge like them either in the neerer, or further Parts of the large U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe, and yet, Forſooth, theſe Holy Saints, muſt be laid at, and reviled by à Petit Dr, though he neither refutes one Miracle Written of them, much leſſe, can caſt à blemish upon their Innocent and Virtuos Lives.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I Say he cannot for ſtark shame deny one<note place="margin">Of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors fraud and Iugling</note> Miracle Authentically recorded of S. Dominick, or S. Francis, having none of Authority to ſide with him, should he deſperately attempt à De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, what does he Therefore? Il' tell you, he proceed's fraudulently, and juggles all along. Firſt he ſlily paſſes over the greateſt Wonders whereby the glory of theſe Saints is moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, not à word ſpoken to this purpoſe, and here <hi>Lies his Fraud.</hi> 2. He pick's out ſome few Miracles recorded by Authors moſt capable, at as he thought of bearing Jeſts, and theſe he ſet's forth with huffs and Scoffs hoping by that pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty varnish to make all ridiculous. Here you have <hi>his Jugling.</hi> And cannot an Atheiſt or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, think ye, would he try his Ieering Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty upon Scripture Miracles (the whole Story of Samſon for example, or of Eves conference with à Serpent) render thoſe in like manner contemptible? Nothing ſeem's more eaſy than to flout, (it is the Dr's Uſual ſtrain) where the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is no gain-ſaying Truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I Say the Dr waves S. Dominicks great Sanctity and choiſeſt Miracles, and never tell's you of his faſting à whole Lent together with bread and water only; of his admirable Charity, of his deſire of Martyrdom, of his profound Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, <hi>in rejecting Eccleſiaſtical Dignities, three

Theſe Authors now mentioned, though vilifiyed by the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, (even Colganus moſt laid at,) produce their Records, Teſtimonies, and <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> in behalfe of every Miracle aſſerted, or at leaſt ſay, they are Producible,) whether

Should not the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, Think ye, had he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Satisfy à judicious Reader, have shewed theſe alledged <hi>Records</hi> and <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> forceleſs, or of no Account? Should he not according to the Method of all Writers, have proved them contradicted by other grave Authors, or at leaſt made their Flawes (if any were) apparent by Cronology, or ſome other Circumſtances wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy à Readers entertainment? Thus <hi>Bollandus' Henſchenius,</hi> and <hi>Papebrochius</hi> whom he cites, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly goe to work, and have Diſcovered upon mature Examination no few miſtakes in matter of Hiſtory? But our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> content only with à bare Relation of what thoſe Authors ſay, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waves this neceſſary Labour, and moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply perſwad's himſelfe, that the <hi>Extravagancy of</hi>

                  <hi>the Wonders</hi> (ſo he ſpeaks) or the ſeeming Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculouſnes of them, is full Proof enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their being ſo much as probable. Alas! your Atheiſts and Heathens may (taught by the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>) upon the ſame Ground deride and jeer at the very moſt of the Miracles recorded in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture. I ſay therefore, Though I am not of ſo eaſy Faith as to believe all that <hi>Capt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> and <hi>Colganus</hi> recount to be manifeſt Truths (if they reach to Probability it's well) yet thus much I Aſſert, that for any thing the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, they may be moſt true, ſo Pitifully and miſerably he handles this whole Matter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You shall ſee by à few Particulars (for I intend not to accompany the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> in his long Carrier all through) whether I ſpeak not Truth. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Creſſy's, whole Book, though once peruſed, I have not at preſent, ſpeak's as the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> tells us of many Saints, <hi>S. Iuſtianus,</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:96808:101"/> 
                  <hi>S. Oſitha, S Clarus</hi> and others, that walked, as the Report goes of S. Denis in France, with their heads cut off. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> in this place should have confuted the Legends this Author relies on, he ought to have proved them counterfeit, by ſome Authority, greater, or of equal poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe with theſe <hi>Legenders.</hi> He might at leaſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve ſaid upon no improbable <hi>Gueſs,</hi> as the more exact Writers do, that many Saints had indeed their Heads cut off, and that to Show they were Martyrs, our Anceſtors painted them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke S. Denis carrying their heads in their hands, which afterwards, Some perhaps, over credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous without due examination, miſtaking the Painters intent, made à Story of. Thus I ſay Judicious men Diſcourſe, whether well or no, I am not to Define, yet know that our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> who waves all reaſoning in this matter, too<note place="margin">Dr Still. page 508.</note> rudely refutes Mr Creſſy, with theſe few boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous words. <hi>What can be imagined more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and be ſuppoſed to be done to leſſe purpoſe, than ſuch foppish Miracles as theſe?</hi> Is not This, as I noted above, to Decry Miracles becauſe they ſeem wonderful, to à vulgar Fancy, and may not à Heathen laugh as lowd at Elias divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the River Jordan with an old Cloak? I am ſure Elias his Action <hi>conſidered in it ſelfe,</hi> is altogether as <hi>Extravagant,</hi> and, if well ſet forth with an Atheiſt's Jeer, may be made eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whit as ridiculous. Pray you Tell me, when the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> after à leaf or two jeer's at Cap<note place="margin">Many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in Scripture as Strange, as thoſe are, the Dr Laughs at.</note> grave and Colganus, who ſay that <hi>S. Aldem</hi> and <hi>S Deicola</hi> hanged their Garments on the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, tell me I ſay, Whether of theſe two Miracles may ſeem the more odd and <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragant.</hi> Viz. That the Sun-beams ſupported
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:96808:102"/> wet Garments, or that Elias his cloak divided Jordan? I think the Wonder is much à like in both, and this the Dr only ſport's with, for he wholly leaves the matter of Fact unexamined. O but Scripture relates what we read of Elias, and old Legends (perhaps very doubtful) give theſe other Stories Credit. A ſimple Reply; For here we Parallel not <hi>humane Authority</hi> with <hi>Divine,</hi> but Ask whether Scripture makes the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles there recorded <hi>Leſſe Wonderful than theſe other?</hi> Moſt evidently No. Therefore the Doctors whole Confutation of Theſe Miracles taken from <hi>their ſeeming Extravagancy,</hi> becomes à ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celeſs Plea, while Scripture in à hundred Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages forces on us the Beliefe of Things as Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge to Fancy, or natural Diſcourſe. What can be more Extravagant than Samſon's taking two<note place="margin">Judges 16. 29.</note> Pillars, whereon à houſe reſted and holding the one in his right hand, and the other in the left, brought ruine by the fall of that Fabrick to three Thouſand Philiſtiens? It is hard to conceive the placing of theſe Pillars ſo fitted to Samſons reach, and the Ruine ſo univerſal that none of the three Thouſand eſcaped; More Inſtances of the like nature you have above.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Out of all I conclude, that as long as<note place="margin">A <hi>Miracle neceſſarily implies Wonder.</hi>
                  </note> the Dr weakens not the humane Authority pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Catholick Writers in behalfe of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (and this he never attempts) ſo long he feed's his Reader with an empty ſound of words, in rejecting Miracles becauſe of their Wonder (for à Miracle neceſſarily implyes à wonder) and moſt juſtly in curr's à Cenſure for his tedious Tattle ſeaſoned with nothing but Jeers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful Calumnies.</p>

The Dr excepts againſt the long lives of ſome Saints related by Colganus. <hi>S.

I think many things amiſſe in your Voluminous Account, But is this enough to refute it?</p>
               <p n="10">10. Now becauſe you inſiſt ſo much upon the Approbation of theſe Books, pleaſe to know,<note place="margin">Two things conſiderable in the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of Books.</note> Two things may be Queſtioned. Firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the particular Miracles recorded by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave and Colganus be in them ſelves exactly true? And to Aſſert this, the Truth of thoſe Records, and Manuſcripts made uſe of, is to be maintained as undoubted, which very few, I am perſwaded, (no not Colganus himſelfe) will affirme, For to aſcertain the unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Verity of ſuch Records much more is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, than to find them Written in old Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or in à ſimple Style, In like manner to prove them Falſe or forged, much more is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, than to jeer or laugh at them, as the Dr doth. The ſecond thing obſervable in the Approbations, is the exact Diligence or Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Collectors of Miracles, ſo far the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations given by learned men reach and no further, as you may ſe by the Cenſure of thoſe who have approved Colganus firſt Tome, Which is to ſay, They approved his Fidelity in relating what he read in ſome Ancient Martyrologies, Though none of theſe kind Cenſurers dare Swear, that all he read there, ought to be owned mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly true without further Examination. Thus Mr Doctor you muſt Diſcourſe, when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:96808:105" rendition="simple:additions"/> you tell us out of <hi>Aelianus, Vopiſcus,</hi> and others, of ſtrange Wonders (like Miracles) wrought by Heathens. If theſe Authors ſpeake as you quote, you are quit of Blame, and ſo far ſpeak Truth, But it doth not therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that either Heathens did Miracles or that the matters of Fact were ſo in themſelves, as tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Authors recount. Juſt ſo it is our preſent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, <hi>Capgrave</hi> and <hi>Colganus</hi> bring to light, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,<note place="margin">Quotations may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as Exact, though the matters quoted be not true.</note> many ſtrange Things, and quote their Manuſcripts for every particular, the Quotations are approved as exact, but whether thoſe <hi>Ancient Manuſcripts</hi> (which may be Written by too ſlight hands, or in à long time perhaps altered from what they once were) punctually relate Truth is another difficulty, and cannot be approved without more Trial, and further Inſpection into matter ſo Prodigious as we find there.</p>

But we, as I noted above, have the like clear humane Teſtimony for Miracles done in the Roman Catholick Church, ſeen by Ey-witneſſes, and openly atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, as that was wrought at Naples upon F. Maſtrilli, and all thoſe were, which God did by our glorious Bishop S. Thomas of Hereford, <hi>Seen I ſay</hi> by many Ey-witneſſes, atteſted by Oath, ſtill preſerved upon Record, and conveyed down by Tradition, as moſt clear, and undoubted Truths. If therefore the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>'s Diſcourſe, when he tell's us that fallible Tradition alone, which ſupplies the want of our Senſes in Conveying upon moral certainty the Miracles of Chriſt to the Primitive Chriſtians and to us alſo, be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout exception Good, The Tradition of theſe
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:96808:106"/> now ſpecifyed Miracles and expreſs Records be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, may well ſerve to convey them to men now living, and to Poſterity hereafter.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Some may Reply, the humane Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in behalfe of Chriſt's Miracles (the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> own's no Tradition Divine and infallible) is both for time and place very <hi>Vniverſal,</hi> and received by all Chriſtians, The Tradition for this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Miracle of Saints, though ſeen and atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted upon Oath, never yet gained the like Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſent, and therefore Cannot be Parallel'd with that other more Univerſal. To Anſwer à<note place="margin">An obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered.</note> ſimple Objection, I ask firſt, whether this way of Arguing be ſolid? Some particulars related of Caeſar and Pompey, (as that they were men once in being, Couragious, and gallant Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits &amp;c.) are received upon Tradition more <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal</hi> than our Saviours Miracles, For all Heathens, Iewes, Turks, and Chriſtians, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily Swallow down Theſe, yet Iewes and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens boggle at Chriſt's Miracles, Ergo they are leſſe certain than thoſe other, becauſe not ſo Univerſally aſſented to? Every rational Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will deny the Conſequence upon this Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und, becauſe our Saviours Miracles being wrought before many, are apt, (did not malice or ſome other accidental Cauſe hinder) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in all à <hi>Vniverſal Aſſent.</hi> This is our Anſwer, which will better appear if we examin things to the bottom. Our Saviour raiſed Lazarus from the dead, cured the blind man, and wrought other great Wonders in ſuch and ſuch particular places, Theſe done before Ey-witneſſes were ſpread abroad, ſome few firſt hearing of them, held all upon <hi>humane Faith</hi> credible. Paſſing further from hand to hand, They became mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96808:107"/> known, and induced many to Aſſent upon this Motive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that prudent men, not ſuſpected of Guile, ſaid they had received them by word of mouth from Perſons very pious who ſaw ſuch matters of Fact, or at leaſt had them from ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers that converſed with thoſe Ey-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Now further; This humane Tradition<note place="margin">Why our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles became more famed than others.</note> (for Still we abſtract in our Diſcourſe hitherto, from Divine Revelation) concerning Chriſt's Miracles, which at firſt took its riſe from Few, as the multitudes of Chriſtians encreaſed, beca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me more Univerſal and generally received, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all that owned our Saviour to be the true <hi>Meſsias,</hi> and moſt deſervedly the greateſt <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturgus</hi> that ever was, held it their Duty to make his admirable Wonders known all over, Fathers preſerved them in the Memory of their Children, Theſe, Age after Age, left them to Poſterity, the Chriſtian Doctors and Paſtors every where ſpread them abroad in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and publick Sermons before whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, Both Iewes and Hereticks alſo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred not à little. Here in briefe (though much more might be ſaid) you have the true Reaſon why our Saviours Miracles were famous the whole world over, and therefore handed down by Univerſal Tradition, which, you ſe, cannot be ſo General in behalfe of Miracles wrought in the Church afterwards, Though they be moſt unqueſtionable. So Providence has ordered, ſo Reaſon alſo Dictates, That <hi>God and man</hi> should be more Univerſally ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured for his admirable Works, than man only, the Lord of all, more than his Servants. Thus much premiſed.</p>

                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:96808:107"/>15. You shall ſee, how far the Parallel goes between our Saviours Miracles, and thoſe wrought by Saints. S. Thomas Cantilupe, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, moſt certainly raiſed many from the dead, So did S. Dominick as is proved above, Others reſtored ſight to the borne blinde &amp;c. Theſe like our Saviour's done before many Spectators in particular Places, were Divulged abroad, and upon humane Faith gained at firſt Credit with thoſe who ſaw them not, Becauſe prudent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of unſpotted Fame, boldly avouched they had ſeen the Wonders. Thus our Saviours Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles became at firſt famed, and induced others (no Spectators) to believe them upon <hi>humane</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The fame of Miracles, firſt groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on ſight and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</note> 
                  <hi>Faith.</hi> From this Fame firſt grounded on <hi>Sight</hi> or <hi>experience,</hi> Tradition took its riſe, and ever ſince Thoſe Miracles were wrought, preſerved à memory of them among men, <hi>Very</hi> Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, as to our Saviours, though leſſe general in behalfe of Saints, for the Reaſons now gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; But this, as I ſaid, impair's nothing the Moral certainty of latter Miracles, ſeing the firſt Ground where on all true Miracles rely (if we keep within the bounds of humane Faith) is <hi>one and the ſame,</hi> That is, They were manifeſtly ſeen, and moſt faithfully related to others.</p>
               <p n="16">16, If therefore our Saviours Miracles beca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me thus Publick before Scripture regiſtred them, and the Miracles of Saints (ſeen and atteſted by Ey-witneſſes) were in like manner ſpread<note place="margin">All true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles apt of their own Nature to gain Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal aſſent</note> abroad before Records preſerved them, It follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, that all, of <hi>their own</hi> Nature, are apt to gain an Univerſal Aſſent, had all been <hi>alike Famed and Vniverſally Published,</hi> but becauſe this Publication (<hi>an effect only of the Wonders</hi>) by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, (or Providence rather,) was different,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:96808:108"/> very general for ſome, not ſo general in others, Hence our Saviours Miracles (as they highly deſerved) gained credit Univerſally, others not ſo Generally, which, as I ſaid, nothing abates their certainty, while the foundamental Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unds. (Viz. <hi>Sight and common Humane conſent</hi>) make all alike morally certain. And thus I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued<note place="margin">Page 1. c. 9. num. 16.</note> againſt Mr Dr in the laſt little Treatiſe. <hi>If the common humane Conſent among Ancient Chriſtians, ſuppoſed neither Divine Revelation nor infallible,</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our Saviours Miracles to an <hi>Evident Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in thoſe Dayes, why should not the like <hi>common Conſent of Chriſtians</hi> now advance our approved Miracles to the ſame certainty, or <hi>Evident Credibility?</hi> O but many boggle at the Miracles of the Church!

                  <p n="10">10. I ſay firſt. It is far more certain, that true Miracles have been wrought in the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church than that S. Chryſoſtom wrote this very Homily the Dr quotes, For all Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, the Fathers Greek, and Latin, yea S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom himſelfe, all Chriſtians Generally, even Hereticks and Turks likewiſe, ever owned lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Miracles as moſt unqueſtionable, but there is no ſuch Aſſurance had of S.

                  <p n="11">11. To prove my Aſſertion, Know Reader that S. Chryſoſtom's chief Aime in this Homily is to Show the wonderful work of God in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the world by Twelve Poor unlearned Fishermen, which yet his Alſeing Providence effected, as the Saint Demonſtrat's in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Chapter, when God made choiſe of the <hi>weak and moſt abject</hi> (ſo the Apoſtle ſpeak's) to evacuate and deſtroy the Pride and wiſdom of<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 19</note> the world, to the End, <hi>no Flesh might glory in his ſight.</hi> Hence it is, that the Apoſtles were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with two great Priviledges, the one, ſaith S. Chryſtom, was to receive by Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration<note place="margin">The Apoſtles honoured with two ſpecial Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.</note> what ever they taught; We now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (not ſo priviledged) want that particular Prerogative, and deliver Chriſt's Doctrin ſet down in Scripture which we received from thoſe firſt great Lights of the Church. The 2. Grace granted the Apoſtles was to work Miracles, as the Goſpel expreſſes? <hi>Having called the twelve Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>

Chryſoſtom's true meaning. <hi>Had God now</hi> (after thoſe firſt Apoſtical Signs, and all other conſpicuous Miracles wrought in the Church) ſent Twelve rude, unlearned men to Preach the whole world over, had he made them <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Thaumaturgi,</hi> or impowered them to work Miracles publickly in all Nations, and to cure all manner of Infirmities as the Apoſtles did; Had he, I ſay, done this after ſo great <hi>precedent Evidence</hi> manifeſted both Anciently and in latter Ages, the minds of men overwhelmed (as it were) with too much Light, would have loſt much of the reward due to an humble and obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious<note place="margin">Providence has ordered that à mean be held in the Motives to Faith.</note> Faith, which ever implies à Captivation of the underſtanding.

                  <p n="13">13. Thus much I boldly averr is S. Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom's chiefeſt Aime in this Homily, if the Dr reject's the Doctrin, let him once pleaſe to gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve weight for weight, and reduce his Aſſertion to as ſound Principles as mine oppoſite to his, ſtand's upon. I show firſt that Chryſoſtom own's Miracles wrought in the Church above the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of nature, not only here, but in à hundred other places. One only Paſſage, becauſe it bear's the Look of à Popish Miracle you shall have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of his own undoubted Writings, where the Saint largely laies forth the Dignity of Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthood. <hi>When,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Prieſt invok's the Holy Ghoſt; and Offer's that dreadful Sacrifice full of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. Chryſ. de Sacerdo. lib. 6. c. 4.</note>

                     <hi>are wont to do, when the King is preſent. And this,</hi> ſaith the Saint, <hi>I eaſily believe. Another man alſo of moſt vvorthy credit told me</hi> (they are S. Chryſoſtoms words) what he had ſeen and heard,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96808:116"/> and t'was, that thoſe who depart this life, if they have worthily and with à pure Conſcience received the Divine Myſteries, being ready to dye. are accompanied ſtraight to Heaven by Angels, that like troups of Souldiers attended their Bodies, lying ſick in bed.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. What ſaies the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, are not theſe clear Miracles above all natural force, done to the Honour of our Sacrificed Sauiour upon our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Alters, And much like ſuch Miracles as we read of in other approved Authors?

                  <p n="15">15. The ſecond Reaſon of my Aſſertion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies upon S. Chryſoſtom's own Diſcourſe proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in the Homily cited.

You ſe that Hell gates, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre all attempts, were never yet able to Prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le againſt the Church built on à firm Rock; which had never been, had not Chriſt ſtood with it, and Powerfully oppoſed all Enemies. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the Saint exhort's all to Piety and à Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life. O were our Duty herein faithfully complyed with, we might, ſaith he, Convert the world without Miracles. But who amongſt us now retires to the Deſart? Who goes on
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:96808:116" rendition="simple:additions"/> Pilgrimage? Who of our Doctors takes pains to ſupply the want of the poor and needy? Thus S. Chryſoſtom.</p>
                  <p n="16">16.

And this Power we may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Say (never ſince granted to any <hi>ſet number of Perſons in the Church) ceaſes,</hi> or is taken away, But can any one hence inferr, that becauſe that Ordinary Gift ended with the Twelve, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none in the Church by <hi>Special Diſpenſation</hi> work's Miracles now? The Inference is lame and juſt like this, The bleſſed Apoſtles, as S.

Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: The Paſtors and Doctors of the Church in after Ages taught not Priviledged with the like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Inſpiration, Ergo</hi> none of them ever ſince delivred one Chriſtian Verity, For Though we grant them Divine Aſſiſtance in their teaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet <hi>becauſe that fall's short of the Apoſtles Inſpiration,</hi> they never taught Truth.

Notwithſtanding to verify that certain Prediction <hi>of greater wonders,</hi> I ſaid, more blinde have ſeen more dead have riſen to Life again, more poor have received the Goſpel in the later Ages of the Church than before, while our Saviour was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon earth, and this is undeniable, unleſſe S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin's Authority and all humane Faith be banis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed the world. Hence I often Paralled Miracles
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:96808:125"/> wrought in the Church with thoſe done by the Apoſtles, ever giving Preheminence to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours glorious Wonders, and withal yeilded, as you may ſee above, à ſingular Prerogative granted the Apoſtles in working Miracles by <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Commiſsion,</hi> which none (known to me) in the Church ever had ſince, or if any had it, the favour was ſingular and not common.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> goes on. <hi>Its true indeed S. Auſtin ſaith there were ſome Miracles ſtill left in the Church, and he produces ſeveral Inſtances elſe where, but in the ſame place, he Denies the Neceſsity of theſe Miracles ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce the large Propagation of Chriſtianity in the world, and account's him à Prodigie, that yet ſeeks after Prodigies to confirm his Faith.</hi> Reader, note firſt how faintly the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſpeak's. <hi>Some Miracles forſooth,</hi> but durſt not name them, fearing they might appear <hi>Great ones,</hi> For ſo They truly are in S.

Turn to the Dr's Quotation, you have it above, where S. Auſtin's Adverſaries propoſed this Queſtion. <hi>Why are not the Miracles you preach done now?</hi> He Anſwers. <hi>Poſſem quidem dicere. I might ſay,</hi> Miracles were neceſſary before the world believed to the End it might believe, And that whoever now ſeek's after Prodigies to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>when the world believes,</hi> is himſelfe à great <hi>Prodigie, if he believes not with the believing World. Thus I might Speak,</hi> ſaith S. Auſtin, which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as every one ſee's, exclud's not Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles from being thought uſeful now, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppoſes them uſeful, when God, as S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin Teſtifies, manifeſtly wrought them among Believers in thoſe Dayes, And therefore ſoon after concludes in the ſame context, <hi>Etiam nunc
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:96808:126" rendition="simple:additions"/> fiunt Miracula Even now Miracles are done in our Age.</hi> Neither could S. Auſtin plead againſt thoſe vain<note place="margin">By what Argument Auſtin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced his Adverſaries</note> Adverſaries by Primitive Miracles, for he Saith expreſſely, They believed none were wrought, Therefore he confutes them by S. Chryſoſtom's excellent Argument uſed above and known to every one, The ſubſtance whereof is, <hi>Either men believed our Chriſtian Verities</hi> induced thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by Miracles, or not; <hi>If by Miracles,</hi> God manifeſted them to the world, <hi>If not;</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Miracle of all is, that the world believed the hard Myſteries of Faith without Miracles. Thus S. Auſtin in this place plainly Diſcover's our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> fraudulent Proceeding.</p>
               <p n="6">6. S. Auſtin next quoted upon the Pſalms<note place="margin">S Auſtin in Pſ. 130. v. 1.</note> ſpeak's of Simon Magus his pretended Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, But has nothing like thoſe words the Dr cites, Though should the Saint either there, or els where Say, <hi>that the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles were vvrought for the benefit of future Ages,</hi> he delivers à great Truth confeſſed by all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought any to <hi>complain</hi> had he done no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, But humbly thank God for showing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny admirable Signs already manifeſted to the world, whereunto none could lay juſt Claime, much leſſe rationally find fault, had they never been wrought. In like manner, had God not Redeemed mankind by ſending his only Begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, but done the work by an Angel or Some other way, none could have juſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, or Challenged as Due that greater Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,<note place="margin">S.

Well, but what Saies S. Auguſtin? He bid's Donatus and Pontius plead no more by the Viſions of this <hi>Brother or that Siſter,</hi> becauſe all are Fictions, Lyes, and monſtrous fallacies. Then he diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Either theſe viſions ſpoken of among you are falſe, Or if any wonders be wrought there, we are the more to beware of them, <hi>our Lord having foretold us, that falſe Prophets should ariſe and vvork Signs,</hi> which if poſſible, might deceive the Elect. Here you ſee S. Auſtin would not in this place debate the Queſtion with the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, whether God for reaſons beſt known to himſelfe, work's true Miracles by Hereticks, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes or Heathens, but prudently abſtract's from that Controverſy, though he accounted them Lies and monſtruous Fictions.

Auguſtine in that place compares the Miraculous cures wrought by our Saviour on Souls now, with thoſe which he anciently did upon Bodies here on earth, and calls theſe <hi>the leſſer cures,</hi> grounding his
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:96808:128"/> Diſcourſe upon this Principle. <hi>As the Soul is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re excellent,</hi> than the Body, ſo à cure wrought in that nobler part of man, is greater than Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles done upon à Body, which our Lord did to draw men to Faith. Now, ſaith the Saint, when Faith is ſpread all the world over, He work's thoſe greater <hi>wonders in Souls,</hi> And for<note place="margin">Spiritual Cures eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med greater, than Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</note> that cauſe shewed thoſe leſſer done on Bodies. <hi>Now he open's not the Eyes of the blind, yet open's the blind hearts of men by the Preaching of his Doctrin. Novv he raiſes not dead Bodies, yet brings à foul, that vvas dead to life again. Novv the deaf hear not, yet the hearts of many shut to his ſacred vvord, are ſo ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that they Believe and live in obedience to his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vves, before neglective of that duty,</hi> Thus S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, whoſe main Drift is not to deny Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous cures wrought upon the infirm, (for theſe he evidently own's above) but to give Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence to our Saviours own <hi>proper Spiritual cures</hi> dayly wrought in the Church of God by Divine Grace and the preaching of his word, which the Saint deſervedly eſteem's greater wonders.</p>
               <p n="12">12. To the End you may ſee this was the<note place="margin">S Aug. l. 22 de Civit. c. 8.</note> only thing S. Auguſtine aimed at. Turn once mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to his eight Chapter, where you read of the dead raiſed to life, of the blind reſtored to their ſight, and of deſperate diſeaſes perfectly cured. You read moreover of one <hi>Martialis</hi> à Prime grave man moſt averſe from Chriſtian Religion,<note place="margin">Martialis cured in ſoul and body.</note> who by the earneſt prayers of his Pious <hi>Sonin-Law</hi> made at S.

Certainly no, for all know, that as the Donatiſts laid claim to true Miracles, they alſo pretended to be the only true Church. Was that ſo, becauſe they Pretended? There is à vaſt difference, Mr Dr between à <hi>great</hi> Pretence, and à <hi>strue</hi> Pretence, the firſt thoſe Hereticks might have, but not the ſecond, unleſs you will ſay (and I am affraid you would fain be at it, durſt you <hi>ſpeak Fully.</hi>) That the Donatiſts Miracles and Viſions were every whit as Good and ſound, as thoſe which S. Auſtin recount's in his 8. Chapter cited.

               <p n="16">16. To confront the Dr's wild Propoſition, I ſay, neither <hi>Vives, nor Canus, nor any Catholick Author ever deſtroyed the Credibility of Miracles in the Church of Rome,</hi> no Catholick Author ever yet denyed true and moſt glorious Miracles to have been wrought in this great Body of Chriſtians. The Dr's Teſtimonies therefore not faithfully
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96808:131"/> Quoted, (were they as he would have them) are meer Impertinences, and prove nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Miracles. Obſerve Reader his ſimple and fallacious Proceeding. Canus, ſaith he, and ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers recount Miracles Written in the lives of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Saints, which in their Judgements were no Miracles, becauſe Written upon very uncertain reports. <hi>Ergo,</hi> theſe Authors doubt and deny all true Miracles which they openly profeſſe to have been wrought in the Roman Catholick Church. Is this way of Arguing tolerable? Can any man inferr, becauſe one Queſtions or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes ſome things, he therefore Queſtions or denyes matters whereof he has certain aſſurance? I certainly know Dr Still has quoted many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors amiſſe, do I therefore ſay he Quotes none right, when I find (though ſeldome) the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage entire he remits me to?</p>

                  <p>A briefe Account of the Dr's large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion from his Page 595. to Page 664. Of his falſe Quotations and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious way in Arguing. The reſt Shewed à long liſt of impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. REader you have three things chiefly in the Pages here noted, Firſt, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Teſtimonies taken out of latter Authors quoted moſt unſincerely, ſome, as the Dr thinks, prove great Miracles to have ceaſed in the Church, <hi>And all thoſe are falſe.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers much inveigh againſt the forging of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, which though truly Quoted are nothing, as I now ſaid, to our preſent Purpoſe. A Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing and moſt blamable, is the Dr's fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious way of arguing, who would fain draw his main Document <hi>of Miracles ceaſing, from this unſound principle. Some pretended Miracles have been proved counterfeit, Therefore none ought to be ovvned true.</hi> The laſt thing worth reflection relates to many Notorious Impertinencies. Of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe in order, and firſt we begin with the Dr's Quotations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He cites. 1. John Gerſon, and partly<note place="margin">Gerſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratio ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritat tom. 1 page 415,</note> conceal's, partly pervert's the genuine Sence of this Author, who relies on à certain Principle (waved by the Dr) and delivers moſt true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96808:134"/> 
                  <hi>As,</hi> ſaith Gerſon (citing Ariſtotle) <hi>it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not that ſome things falſe in themſelves, are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable than others true. So import's not if ſomethings fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe in themſelves be piouſly believed, not as falſe (for if known as falſe) it is far from the Piety of the faithful to believe them. The Eſtimation or pious credulity therefore fall's not upon the verity or falſity, but only upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and probability, while the falſity or verity is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; Hence S. Hierom prudently ſaid, it's better in ſuch matters piouſly to doubt, than rashly to define. Two</hi>

                  <hi>contradictories may both be probable, and the one well ſtand's with the other, not in Truth, but in Probability; Thus under different Reſpects, both may be believed wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout Prejudice to Faith, ſo that the mind be free from pertinacy.</hi> Reader, what is hitherto amiſs in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Doctrin, while he teaches nothing (the Dr conceal's this) but à Truth known the whole world over? For who is there, that believes not matters only probable <hi>in appearance,</hi> whereof there is no abſolute certainty? Hath the Dr I beſeech you, certainty of all things that paſſe his head, or believes upon humane Faith? Gerſon goes on. <hi>This Degree of certainty reſpect's the Legends and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of Saints, the Lives of Fathers, and the Viſions of devout Perſons</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Which the Church embraces and permit's to be read, not that it determin's them to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved as neceſſary for Saluation, But becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to move the pious affections of the faithful, ſo long as nothing in ſuch matters is known to be falſe, although alſo nothing is known upon certainty to be true, ſo in thoſe things, that by à pious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be done, is more to be regarded, than what was done.</hi> Thus Gerſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now hear the Dr's own words Written in à different Character. Gerſon ſaith he, <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly confeſſes, this to be the End of the Legends
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:96808:135"/> and Miracles of Saints, and their Viſions and Revelations ſo much talked of in the Roman Church.</hi> Viz. <hi>To ſtir up the Piety and Good affections of the People: For theſe things, ſaith he, are not propoſed by the Church to be believed as true, but they are rather to conſider them, as things that might be done, than things that vvere done.</hi> Reflect Reader in paſſing how the Dr condemn's himſelfe by his own words, for if Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſpeaks, as moſt certainly he doth, of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and viſions read in the Lives of Saints, not propoſed <hi>by the Church to be believed as true,</hi> but only permitted to be read, He oppoſes no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, no Viſions, <hi>approved by the Church, or ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as true;</hi> Nay, theſe he plainly ſuppoſes in his precedent words <hi>Priuſquam elucidaretur alio mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi>

Let therefore approved Miracles ſtand firm without controule, we have our intent, and will while the Dr lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes both his time and cauſe Do as S Hierom prudently adviſes, <hi>rather piouſly doubt of theſe Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendary Miracles, than rashly define any thing.</hi> The Dr end's his <hi>Harangue</hi> thus. Gerſon ſaith, <hi>it is no matter, if ſome things that are really falſe be piouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed, ſo they be not believed as falſe, or known falſe, at the ſame time.</hi> The Dr thought this word <hi>Falſe</hi> would rattle lowd in à vulgar eare, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas had he diſtinguished as Gerſon doth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Truth in <hi>appearance</hi> or Probability, and <hi>perhaps</hi> no Truth <hi>in re,</hi> the noiſe would have ceaſed. Has not many à man upon great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, been deemed honeſt and ſo procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with that really was otherwiſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an one probably thought dishoneſt, who deſerved not that Cenſure?

Miracles Judged probable, or in appearance only, have their End which as Gerſon ſaith, is to ſtir up Devotion, though no man goes about to prove the Church infallible by them, as the Dr too ſimply Imagin's.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Three or four Quotations yet remain taken out of <hi>Lyranus, Cajetan, Launoy,</hi> and <hi>Luke d'Achery</hi> as weightleſſe and witleſſe he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, as if the Dr had told you à tale of à Tub. Theſe Authors, Reader, worthily bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me all forgery in Miracles, and ſo do I, They moreover tax ſome Writers off Errours, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting the Geſts of Saints, and I highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud them when they ſpeak Truth and prove it, yet all are far from denying true Miracles to have been wrought in the Roman Catholick Church, wherein lies the whole Debate betwixt the Dr and me. Obſerve I beſeech you; The Dr makes à great Account of one Teſtimony produced out of <hi>Luke D'Achery,</hi> who ſet forth the<note place="margin">Lucas d'A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery lib. 1. c. 1. 2. 3. de pignoribus Sanctorum Paris print 1651.</note> works of Venerable Guibertus Abbot of Novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gento, where ſome things, thought by the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, great matters, (though meer Illuſions) are much reproved. For an Inſtance. A Boy belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to à Souldier chanced to dye on good Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the People becauſe he dyed that day, made reſort to his Tomb, offered wax candles, and ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her little Donaries as Teſtimonies of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. Some feigned themſelves deaf, ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers lame, and the Abbot of that place, (willing enough to have men think that Miracles were wrought there) gave encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to à beliefe of theſe Fopperies. Two or three Stories of the like nature <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery</hi>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:96808:136"/> relates out of venerable Guibert. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin all be faithfully told, And ask as I did above, whether this Conſequence be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable? <hi>Falſe Miracles have paſſed among the Vulgar for true ones, Ergo never true Miracles were wrought in the Church?</hi> I Ask again whether this Argument be not à clear conviction <hi>ad hominem?</hi> D'r Still believes the venerable Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of Novigent in the Relation he gives of feigned Miracles, which ſome by abuſe jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged true, Ergo if we plead by the <hi>Abbots Authority,</hi> Dr Still is obliged to believe him, when he plainly ſet's down and own's true Miracles to have been wrought. But moſt<note place="margin">An Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dr.</note> evidently the Abbot confeſſes à hundred times over, that God has done innumerable great Miracles in the Church, Therefore if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves credit in his Relation of Cheats, why should he loſe it in the other part of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now to point at all the true Miracles<note place="margin">D'Achery Lib. de Laude B. virg. c. 10. 11. à pag. 302.</note> owned by this Abbot would be à long Task, Two or three ſet down in D'Achery, whereof one moſt prodigious wrought upon à woman called <hi>Theodeberta</hi> by the aſſiſtance of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Mother of God, may give Satisfaction to every Reader. In à word, this Theodeberta condemned to Dy for having Slain à young man that ſolicited her to Lewdnes, after earneſt Prayer made to the bleſſed Virgin, humbly confeſſed her fault, and vpon her Publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion was to be burned in à great Pile of wood. There tied to à Stake halfe naked,<note place="margin">A Stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſeen by many Ey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>witneſſes.</note> (the wood wholly conſumed) the bands alſo wherewith the was bound burnt to Ashes; Theodeberta ſtood ſtill in the middle of the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:96808:136"/> Flame without any hurt at all. Her Enemies ſeing this, furiouſly heaped more wood upon her, ſet that on fire, and barbarouſly ſtruck the poor Penitent with their long Poles, but all would not do, not ſo much as one hair of her head, nor the Linnen-wear she had on, much leſs any part of her Body, received Dammage. This Miracle recounted by Guibert in the place now cited, was ſeen and atteſted by innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ey-witneſſes. What ſaies our Dr, muſt the Abbot be believed, when he Tell's us of Cheats, and loſe all credit while he recount's true and undoubted Miracles? Had the Dr dealt ingenuouſly, he should have Said, Abbot Guibert ('tis true) ſpeaks of many Impoſtures practized in that Age, But withall own's <hi>unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable Miracles.</hi> This latter, Mr Dr fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently omit's, and therefore notoriouſly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes againſt ſincerity in ſetting down one halfe of à Story, without the other.</p>
               <p n="6">6. What followes in the Dr to his Page 610. is ſuch flight ſtuff as you have heard, little worth notice; So is that too often babbled out Flaw imputed to Baronius, who it ſeem's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtook the Signification of the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

Such trash as this out of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſomnes I paſſe by, and will examin other Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, where you shall ſee far greater flawes on the Dr's part, than the miſtake of à Greek word comes to.</p>

Toſtatus demand's why God in the conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> the firſt high Prieſt, ſent fire from Heaven to conſume his Sacrifice? And Anſwer's, the Miracle was not done principally for Aaron, but to teſtify how the Sacrifice of any Prieſt, became accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to Almighty God, And therefore, ſaith Toſtatus, there appeared no neceſſity of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame Miracle renewed at the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other Prieſts.

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:96808:137"/> was firſt preached, <hi>Fuerunt iſta neceſſaria,</hi> thoſe viſible great Signs were neceſſary to introduce it, but now being eſtablished, there ought not to be <hi>any ſuch Miracles.</hi> Thus moſt faithfully<note place="margin">Toſtatus true Doctrin laid forth, with the Dr's jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> Toſtatus, if you doubt turn to the Place cited, and believe your own Eyes. That done, you may juſtly admire the jugling and too open fraud of this Dr, who, forſooth, becauſe Toſtatus Saies, (and truly) that thoſe Viſible <hi>Signs of the Holy Ghoſt deſcending upon the converted,</hi> newly baptized, are not ſeen in this Age, will needs thence infer, that he Denies all other Miracles. Is this either Conſcience or any conſequence? <hi>God showes no more ſome kind of Miracles, Ergo he works none at all?</hi> May not I truly aſſert, that God in the latter Ages of the Church never wrought ſo many prodigious wonders at once, as he did at our Saviours Sacred Paſſion, when the Sun was darkned, the Rocks were ſplit, the Dead came out of their Graves &amp;c. Can any hence inferr, That I therefore Deny all other Miracles wrought <hi>at Loreto, at Compoſtella, and Sichem?</hi> Certainly No. Becauſe though I grant not ſuch admirable Wonders ever to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve happened ſince our Saviours death, I may yet aſſert the latter to be as they are, manifeſt Truths.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. To lay yet more open the Dr's fraud, I Argue thus. If the learned Toſtatus plainly ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledges true ſupernatural Miracles wrought in the Church after the Apoſtles time, different from thoſe which he ſaith, ceaſed, The Dr groſly abuſes this Author; But Toſtatus moſt evidently own's ſuch true Miracles in the Church Therefore Mr Dr groſly abuſes Toſtatus. For proof of my Aſſertion, turn once more to this
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:96808:138"/> Author, where he expreſly teaches. 1. That<note place="margin">Toſtat. in c. 10. Mart. Queſt. 12. John 14.</note> Chriſt impowred all that believe in him to work Miracles, <hi>yea and greater</hi> than He wrought. He teaches. 2. That both Martyrs and Confeſſors long after our Saviours death preaching up and down the world, <hi>Multa Miracula fecerunt,</hi> did many Miracles, though Chriſt ſpake not to them, nor <hi>Specially</hi> gave them the Power whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewith the Apoſtles were priviledged. He ſaies<note place="margin">Tostatus plainly grants true Miracles.</note> 3. That all believing in Chriſt, by invoking the Holy name of JESUS, may work Miracles, with much more that followes. Tell me Reader, is it not prodigiouſly ſtrange, that the Dr remit's us to this Queſtion, while he <hi>Wilily</hi> ſlips over all here noted point blank againſt him? Is not<note place="margin">Dr Still. page 611.</note> this Fraud and worſe than jugling manifeſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible, when upon this Principle, <hi>Some Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles have ceaſed,</hi> he would conclude, there are none at all wrought?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. If you Ask what it was that beguiled the Dr in à right underſtanding of Toſtatus? Thus it is. Toſtatus in the beginning of the Queſtion now cited, demand's, why our Preachers in the Church who ſuceed the Apoſtles, do not ſuch Miracles now, <hi>Talia Miracula</hi> Viz. <hi>By ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Commiſsion,</hi> as the Apoſtles did? He Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer's moſt profoundly, that ordinary Power was readily given the Apoſtles to work Miracles eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where in confirmation of Chriſt's Doctrin; ſo it is ſaid. They went forth, and preached in all places <hi>ubique Deo concurrente,</hi> God Coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with <hi>Signs that followed.</hi> Now ſaith Toſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus that ordinary Power, was not only annexed to thoſe firſt Apoſtolical men, but alſo to the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converted and baptized, For theſe after their Baptiſm and converſion, were impowred to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:96808:138"/> work Miracles, whereby the Truth and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<note place="margin">The Dr's Cheat, diſco<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vered.</note> of Chriſt's Doctrin received much light, And this Ordinary certain Power of working Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles every where, ceaſes in the <hi>Prelates of the Church.</hi> Whence our Dr would inferr à ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Miracles, which, as I ſaid, is worſe than jugling, and moſt oppoſite to the expreſs Doctrin of Toſtatus. O but the Bishop ſaith<note place="margin">Toſtatus cited à §. Tertio fit.</note> this Power of working Miracles would not be profitable in the Church but rather ſerve for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity; Very true; For if, as he obſerves, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were dayly wrought amongſt us by the <hi>Prelates of the Church, and new Convertits,</hi> the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Faith would be much leſſened, and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore<note place="margin">Toſtatus §. ſecundo</note> ſaies firſt, it is unworthily done by à true faithful Believer to ſeek after Miracles to confirm the Faith <hi>which he actually believes as certain,</hi> For this were to require à further probation of that, which he hold's moſt undoubted. 2. Though Miracles are not neceſſary when faith is preached to Believers yet they are <hi>profitable,</hi> when its prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched<note place="margin">Toſtatus cited §. au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</note> to Infidels or Hereticks. Thus To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatus.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. One may yet object. The Doctrin of Chriſt, of the Apoſtles, and the Church is one and the ſame, if therefore no Believer ought curiouſly to deſire new Miracles to confirm the Doctrin of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, why should they require new Miracles to confirm Church Doctrin, Or to what End hath God wrought Miracles in every Age? I Anſwer firſt; No <hi>Catholick Believer</hi> ought to ask for more Miracles than Divine Providence hath already manifeſted, becauſe the Truth of Church Doctrin by what is done, is made <hi>Evidently Credible,</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding God out of his abundant mercy may at his
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:96808:139"/> good pleaſure illuſtrate this Oracle with new Miracles, as we have proved above, The U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility<note place="margin">Miracles wrought in the Church much abate the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</note> whereof gathered from Toſtatus laſt cited, avail's much <hi>to convince Hereticks</hi> that impudently calumniate the Church, Saying She hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Doctrin of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, God therefore to repreſſe this Impudence, as he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the Doctrin of Chriſt <hi>Evidently Credible</hi> by the Miracles which our Saviour wrought, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Apoſtles <hi>Evidently Credible</hi> by the Miracles They did, ſo alſo he ſet's forth the glory of his own Oracle the Church, and makes her Doctrin evidently credible by innumerable Miracles wrought Age after Age. And this I conceive to be à main reaſon, why Providence will have Miracles continued in the Church to the worlds End.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The Dr once more referr's us to Toſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,<note place="margin">Toſtatus in cap. 3.

                     <hi>weighty than this in our caſe, it being from one, who undoubtedly knew all the Pretences to Miracles then made?</hi> I beſeech you, Reader, turn firſt to Roffenſis, where he showes, that true Miracles are not to be rejected, becauſe ſome have made pretence to falſe ones, and tell's Oëcolampadius that for one feigned Invocation of à Magician the Sectary urged, we Catholicks can produce innumerable true Miracles whereof, ſaith the Bishop, I shall ſpeak more in the Preface to my ſecond Book. Again he ſaith, though à Magician may dazle our Eyes with his Charms, yet all true Miracles undoubtedly done by good Angels, are not therefore to be rejected. <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit iſtud à piorum mentibus,</hi> far be this Errour from the minds of pious men.

Theſe, ſaith Roffenſis, if thou Oëcolampadius weigheſt diligently, and yet doſt continue in thy obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, thy heart is hardned, but becauſe thou durs't not contradict the Powerful hand of God who did theſe Wonders, Thou help's on our Catholick cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="13">13.

How could ſo learned à Prelate oppoſe Miracles in one part of his Works, and vigorouſly maintain them (as you ſee done) in the places now ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and many others?

               <p n="15">15. One ſtand's thus awry, or rather on no
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:96808:151"/> foundation. The Saint had not the Gift of Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues<note place="margin">Epiſt Ja<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pan 3 p. 30.</note> as appear's by one of his Letters for, He could not reach in Japan for want of Language. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this were true, doth it therefore follow that he never had that Gift? The Depoſitions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged prove he was endued with it, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps God denyed at the beginning and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his Power the better, afterward imparted the Favour. I would willingly have peruſed that <hi>Epiſtle Iapan 3. p.</hi> 30. but cannot meet with it,<note place="margin">Antwerp print. 1657.</note> though I have 4.

Books, much leſſe in the 30. page I am remitted to. If the Dr has any other Epiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, I would know where they are printed.</p>
               <p n="16">16. A ſecond Objection. The Dr finds not that S. Xaverius in any of his Epiſtles made Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to the Power of Miracles, Though after his death the Jeſuits told many Stories of them. Anſw. The humble Saint learned that ſilence from his great Maſter Chriſt JESUS, who after cleanſing à Leper ſaid, <hi>nemini dixeris,</hi> Tell no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne what I have done; And this way S. Xaverius<note place="margin">Mark. 1. 44</note> followed; when urged to declare the Miracle wrought by him in rayſing à young man dead to life in the Promontory of Comorinum, He<note place="margin">Se this in Emanuel Acoſta im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly before the 8. page.</note> blushed, and declined an Anſwer, But preſſed further, ſaid.

               <p n="17">17. A third Objection. The Preſervation of S. Xaverius's dead Body caſt into quick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me was not Miraculous, But an ordinary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:96808:151"/> of Nature ſaith our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, becauſe learned Phiſicians have declared, that Bodies may be preſerved incorrupt by <hi>ſalt, Nitre,</hi> or <hi>Lime.</hi> The D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> it ſeem's has ſo much Kindneſſe as to believe this matter of Fact, whether Miraculous or no, becauſe Authors relate it, Why doth he not alſo believe thoſe others forementioned Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as raiſing the dead (for an Inſtance) upon the Teſtimony of Authors altogether as credita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? By no means will the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Say, For in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo he muſt admit Miracles. Reader, mark the Genious of this man. When à Miracle is clear the Authority of thoſe who aſſert it, is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryed, when diſputable (as he would have it in this preſent caſe) the Atteſtation paſſes for good, but the Miracle (shifted off by another trick) <hi>muſt be none.</hi> Thus Authority riſes and fall's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Dr's fancy, for had he truly Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this incorruption Miraculous, would he not think you have ſaid, it want's ſufficient Atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

                  <hi>out of the Prophets, and the Goſpel,</hi> But willing to make the Relation full, and acceptable, he firſt uſed different Expreſſions from the preciſe words of Scripture, which all Preachers and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters do in their further Explanations of Holy Writ. 2. As Occaſion required he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many pious Conſiderations moſt Suitable, as he thought, to beget in the Emperours mind à high Reſpect and honour of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. 3.

               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:96808:155"/>3. I ſay contrary. F. Xavier neither adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated the Sence nor any one word of the Holy Goſpel, For to deprave and adulterate the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is either to Propoſe ſome thing as <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or, as revealed by Almighty God <hi>which God never Spake in Scripture</hi> (This the Father did not): Or to Produce à true Revelation there expreſſed <hi>and to Pervert, or contradict it.</hi> Now Show me, Mr Dr, by the Help of your falſe <hi>Dieu,</hi> where F. Xavier either <hi>pervert's à Revealed Truth,</hi> which is<note place="margin">The Father depraved not the Goſpel. And why?</note> in Scripture, or propoſes that as the <hi>Revealed word of God</hi> (and mark my Expreſſion) which is not in Scripture, and you touch the Point, But this is impoſſible, the Father being far from ſuch Transgreſſions, Therefore prudently Entit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les his Book, <hi>not the Revealed vvord of God, but the Hiſtory of Chriſt,</hi> partly much enlarged by Circumſtances which eaſily might occur to every Pious mind (yea and probably happen), and partly augmented with the Teſtimonies of other Authors.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For an Inſtance of the firſt. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">De Dieu page 41.</note> cited by De Dieu, ſuppoſes our Lady de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly on her Knees about Midnight bowing her head towards the ground, when the Angel came to Salute her, This no more <hi>but à piovs Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,</hi> was never Propoſed to the Emperour as à Truth revealed by Almighty God. Again, when he relates upon humane Authority that in<note place="margin">De Dieu page 74.</note> the night of our Saviours Birth, the great Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Peace</hi> at Rome fell down, and that much about the ſame time, three Suns were ſeen in Spain which cloſed at laſt together like one Sun, He tells us, <hi>Sapientes dicunt;</hi> Wiſe men Say the Viſion pointed out the great light of the world, then appearing in Bethlem. Obſerve
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:96808:156"/> the Expreſſion, <hi>wiſe men,</hi> (whether then living or afterwards, imports not,) Judged ſo, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore he never propoſed this as <hi>à Truth revealed by Almighty God in Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And thus Reader you have briefly the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable fraud of <hi>De Dieû</hi> and our Dr diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who will needs impoſe upon F.

They avouch, he told all theſe Particulars and more, as Verities revealed by Almighty God, and words contained <hi>in the Holy Goſpel.</hi> Whereas it is evident, by his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Writing And own Expreſſions, no ſuch thing can be meant, Though deſirous to make the Hiſtory of Chriſt compleat, he grounded himſelfe firſt upon the exact Truths recorded in the Prophets, and the Goſpel, with à further Enlargement, as you have heard. The Dr the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore yet living is obliged to recall what he has falſely ſaid. And to take off his foul Aſperſion unjuſtly laid upon à moſt laudable Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In like manner I Anſwer to the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made againſt the Story of the B.

               <p n="7">7. In the next place our Dr falls foule upon the Father for aſſerting Iſſachar to have been High Prieſt, when S. Joachim offered up
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:96808:156"/> his Sacrifice in the Temple. It is true, Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius cited ſaies Iſſachar could be no high Prieſt, <hi>Then,</hi> But tell me, Reader, is not this <hi>à</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable fault in à poor Miſſioner (who if miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) thought he had S. Hierom's Authority for his Aſſertion, And then neither did nor could know what Baronius had Written of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Were the Dr's groſſe Errours when he Quotes Authors falſly as I have Demonſtrated; When he produces Teſtimonies for the ceaſing of Miracles in the Church, though he ſaw thoſe very <hi>VVriters</hi> he cites moſt expreſſe for glorious Miracles in latter Ages; When he looks back upon his Jugling and foul perverting the plain Sence of Authors; When he call's to mind his unjuſt Calumny Laid on Jeſuits as men, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, who think it Lawful to Lye for à good cauſe &amp;c. Theſe and many more Abominable frauds I have diſcovered in the Dr, (though to uſe his own words upon another Occaſion,) <hi>he little thought they would ever come to light.</hi> Were ſuch groſſe falſities, I ſay, as minute and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable as that one ſmall Overſight is of F. Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, Mr Dr might rejoyce, And read theſe my Writings over with à merrier heart, than he is like to do, But his Errours are horrible, and without ſerious repentance, unpardonable. The reſt that followes in the Dr of the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins retyred life in the Temple, of her vow of Virginity, which grave Authors affirm (The<note place="margin">Baron.

               <p n="8">8. Our Dr willing to make his Imputations caſt on F. Xaverius relishable, and to gain his precious Author <hi>De Dieu</hi> credit, cites Philip A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagambe, who ſaies the Text of <hi>Dieu</hi> his Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

This Mr Dr conceal's, yet Methinks, if Alagambe merits credit in the one, his word alſo may well be taken for the other. The Dr at the cloſe of<note place="margin">Dr Still. page 623.</note> his Diſcourſe thinks he hath ſaid enough, <hi>not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſtop the mouth of E.

               <p n="9">9. The Dr from his Page 624. to 663. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's little worth reflection, or any Reply. In à word he ſeem's much like ſome poor Fellowes in our Cities, that goe up and down the Streets, and caſt into naſty Carts all the filth and Dirt they meet with, And I verily think, gain more by that Sordid Employment, Than the Dr gets<note place="margin">Forged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Dr. wholly impertinent.</note> by his long and tedious Narration of forgeries and falſe Miracles impiouſly Pretended to have been wrought, when none were. This I call Dirt buſily Scraped up by the Dr, and caſt into the Pages now mentioned, But for what End or Purpoſe is hard to ſay. Is it to tell us that Cheats and Counterfeits have ſometimes plaid their prancks, and abuſed others? No great Doctorship is required for that which the whole world knowes. Is it to Decry true Miracles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe falſe ones have been forged? A plain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Madnes, For ſo we should decry true Scripture, becauſe falſe Scripture has been Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered upon the very Apoſtles. Is it to prove à

By this Art and Arguing, Proteſtancy is ruined, For not only Luther and Calvin, as I shewed, feigned Miracles, but ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers alſo of the English Miniſtery have done ſo, Witneſſe that egregious fourb practized by John Dorrell in his pretended Poſſeſſions, and Dipoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of William Summers at Nottingham, of Thomas Darling, the boy of Burton, of Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, and of Katharine Wright at Mansfeild &amp;c. Whereof whole Books have been Written, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open the frauds as you may read in Brerely, who alſo introduces <hi>Dorells notorious cheat</hi> of à Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit<note place="margin">Brerely Tract. 2. c. 3 Sect. 7. ſubd. 5. p. with me 546.</note> ſpeaking in à wall againſt Queen Mary, with the ſleeping Preachers forgery, Diſcovered by his Majeſty King James. VVere it worth the while to gather up more of this filth juſtly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Proteſtants, we could eaſily match Mr Dr, and beſpatter as many Pages with it as he has do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. But who (beſides the Dr) can endure this Nonſenſe? <hi>Some of ſuch à profeſsion have plaid the Knaves, and forged Miracles, Ergo, the Religion that decryes the Forgery, is naught;</hi> Or true Miracles, whereof Chriſtians never doubted, <hi>are to be looked on as Falſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Mr Dr after two tedious Stories, of <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> and <hi>Joannes de Vincentia</hi> held by many Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors, by others not ſo hardly thought of, But rather freed from the guilt (for our purpoſe it imports not to know on whom the blame lies,<note place="margin">Dr Still. page 635.</note> the Accuſers or the accuſed.) Mr Dr <hi>I ſay,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand's. <hi>VVhat credit theſe Reporters of Miracles in the Roman Church deſerve from us, when ſuch Perſons who are by their own Order cryed up</hi> (he alludes to Joannes de Vincentia) <hi>for workers of Miracles,</hi> are by others of their own Church condemned as
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:96808:158"/> Seducers? I Anſwer, in ſuch Oppoſition when<note place="margin">How we Proceed when Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors in their relation of Miracles.</note> Authors contradict Authors, the graveſt and the more rational ought to Sway moſt with every prudent Reader. In caſe Teſtimonies ſtand equally poyſed on both ſides, both Aſſertions will in à <hi>rational appearance</hi> have their Probability, as Gerſon cited above obſerves, Though the Truth of the Miracle conſidered in it ſelfe lies yet out of à clear ſight, <hi>Perhaps it was, and perhaps not.</hi> In ſuch caſes, S. Hierom cited, prudently adviſes, rather piouſly to doubt than rashly to Define any thing, which all Authors do in their contradictory Judgements concerning probable Opinions. Now if the Authority be far more pregnant <hi>for the denying Party,</hi> than the other, the Miracle in conteſt will be prudently eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med little worth, becauſe very doubtful, and the Reporters of it Can never gain much cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. But Say Reader, How doth our good Dr advance his cauſe by railing at the Reporters of falſe and doubtful Miracles decryed by all? How doth he hence prove, that Miracles never called into Queſtion by the wiſeſt of the world, are in like manner to be accounted fourbs, or liſted with thoſe other doubtful? This he aimes at, or ſpeak's nothing to the Purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Upon this Ground all thoſe other Bund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of trash in the Dr's following Pages, appear in their own likeneſſe meer Impertinences. Grant then, That the Dominicans at Bern were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors in forging Miracles, <hi>which is yet denyed by many,</hi> Admit upon <hi>Sleidans</hi> word (worth little) that the Franciſcans at Orleans counterfeited à mute Spirit acting the part of à dead womans Soul, as if She had been damned for being à Lutheran.

I Ask and require an Anſwer, what Advantage gain's this Dr by his painful heaping up ſo much Filth together? Are therefore true Miracles owned by the beſt of Chriſtians, never boggled at, never called into doubt, prejudiced in the leaſt, becauſe Fools have forged falſe ones? It is too lame à Conſequence for any rational Diſcourſer. Thus much truly followes, that ſuch abominable Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy moſt juſtly call's for Vengeance, and unrepented, infer's Damnation. Therefore the Prelates of the Church highly deſerve com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, who when ſuch frauds are diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, both rigidly condemn and inflict ſevere Punishment on the miſchievous Impoſtors.</p>
               <p n="12">12.

                  <p>An Anſwer to one oſ the Doctors Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt Miracles. VVhether Miracles in the firſt Age of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity were but few? How Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are proved by true Doctrin and true Doctrin by Miracles. No coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited Miracle can paſſe the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Tribunal without cenſure. Of à late VVriters exceptions againſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. The admirable Propagation of Christian Religion convinces that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles have been wrought.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WE uſually ſay an Argument that proves too much, proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but all Dr Still. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments propoſed againſt approved Miracles wrought in the Church make every whit as much againſt the Miracles of Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently prove too much, <hi>Therefore nothing at all.</hi> What is here Aſſerted you will find made good in the enſuing Chapters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I replyed to one of the Dr's Exceptions<note place="margin">Page 665.</note> c. 2, n. 17. where he thinks Miracles needleſſe in future Ages, becauſe thoſe wrought by Chriſt and his Apoſtles in confirmation of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, were abundantly ſufficient without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:96808:165" rendition="simple:additions"/> I Said then that none can know by à bare owning thoſe ancient Miracles what Doctrin Chriſt taught, For all called Chriſtians, as Arians and Pelagians, admitted Chriſt's Miracles, yet groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwerved from his Doctrin. Dr Still. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,<note place="margin">None can ſay what Doctrin Chriſt taught by owning only ancient Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</note> admit's all the Miracles our Saviour wrought, yet he shall never prove one Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial point of <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> by them, no more shall the Arian evince any Doctrin of <hi>Arianiſme</hi> true that way; if no other Oracle illuſtrated by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles interpoſes its Authority, and aſcertain's him, that ſuch and ſuch is Chriſt's Doctrin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the greateſt Myſteries of Faith. For example. That Chriſt is <hi>truly God and man, one Eſſence and three diſtinct Perſons</hi> &amp;c, Tell me Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Sence find you in this Inference? Our Saviour raiſed Lazarus from the dead, cured the blind man, cleanſed the Lepers, <hi>Ergo,</hi> God is thereby proved one Eſſence and three diſtinct Perſons? Again if Dr Still. take on to pare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way what Miracles he pleaſes, if he thinks ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will ſufficiently ſerve for future, Ages, I Ask, why are not Chriſt's Miracles alone, excluding thoſe the <hi>Apoſtles wrought,</hi> ſufficient for us all? Nay, why may not only one Miracle wrought by Chriſt (without more, if conveyed down by Tradition) bring with it that <hi>Al-ſufficiency</hi> the Dr ſpeaks of?<note place="margin">Page 666.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Dr, ſeing ſuch abundance of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles pretended to in all Ages and Countries, and finding them ſo ſparingly wrought in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Scripture (unleſs for confirmation of à new Religion) thinks, we muſt either hold that God has changed the Method of his Providence, in being once ſparing, and now too liberal; or that we through ignorance and Credulity take
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:96808:166"/> thoſe for Miracles which are not ſo. Mr Dr's Religion (as Proteſtancy) is one of the neweſt in the world, yet I never heard of any Miracles ſo much as <hi>ſparingly</hi> wrought for its confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But <hi>ad rem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Dr groſly miſtakes. Miracles wrought in the firſt Age of Chriſtianity, were neither ſcarce nor ſparing, but contrarywiſe, <hi>Admirable, great</hi> and <hi>numerous,</hi> in ſo much that no one Age after that, can Parrallel the Miracles then wrought. The Signs and Miracles which Chriſt wrought, ſaith S.

               <p n="13">13. Shall I prove what is here aſſerted, by one clear and convincing Inſtance? Suppoſe Almighty God should pleaſe to ſingle out now Twelve poor Fishermen, and impart many great Secrets never yet known to the world, which cannot be known before they Preach. Having commiſſion from God they run from <hi>City to City</hi> and becauſe ſo commanded, faithfully declare what God told them. For example, The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe time of Antichriſt's comming, when the Day of Judgement will be, how many are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to eternal Glory, how many rejected with other unknown Secrets, but in the mean while<note place="margin">A clear In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what is aſſerted.</note> work no Miracles, show no ſupernatural Signs, <hi>only Speak and Preach.</hi> Would prudent men think ye believe ſuch Teachers, or yeild aſſent to their Doctrin having no rational Motive to ground Beliefe upon, <hi>But their bare word?</hi> It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Had therefore the bleſſed Apoſtles, poor unlearned Fishermen <hi>by words only,</hi> laid forth the Myſteries and high Secrets of our Faith; had they only ſpoken of the ſacred Trinity, of that ineffable Myſtery of God made man, of the Dead riſing to life again, of the eternal pain due to the Damned, and wrought no Miracles, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited no exteriour <hi>ſupernatural Wonders</hi> whereby to make their <hi>Doctrin Credible,</hi> The whole world would have deemed them halfe frantick, and diſpiſed them as cheats, or Authors of Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. We ſe though they wrought ſtupendious

               <p n="14">14. You Say. 2. The Predictions of the Meſſias did all agree to our Saviour and received completion in him. Very true Anſwers the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, though the Iewes deny all, and pervert theſe Propheſies to à ſiniſter Sence, And ſo much more your Barbarous Nations would have done, had the bleſſed Apoſtles at their Preaching, barely <hi>worded it,</hi> or read out of the old Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures what <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> foretold of Chriſt; But when they raiſed the dead to life, cured the Infirm, and viſibly wrought other great Miracles before thoſe they Preach't to, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt hearts relented, and yeilded to their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin.

I Anſwer this whole diſcourſe built upon two falſe Suppoſitions fall's to nothing. One is, that Miracles either ſeen or heard of <hi>preceded</hi> not the firſt converſions of Chriſtians.

               <p n="17">17.

Thoſe Signal Wonders wrought by our Saviour ſenſible and viſible, <hi>as rational Arguments,</hi> firſt induced the bleſſed Apoſtles and ſome few more to believe in him.

VVhatever ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Argument proves Chriſt to have wrought true Miracles by Divine Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as forcibly proves Church Miracles to proceed from the very ſame cauſe. Though Divels may work ſome ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge wonders, they cannot raiſe the Dead, or cure deſperate Infirmities. Of the Aegyptian Magicians Feates.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In this laudable Examination two things may be Queſtioned. The firſt concernes the <hi>matters of Fact,</hi> whether for an Inſtance, God raiſed the dead to life by the Interceſſion of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin">What this due Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires?</note> S. Stephen, of S. Thomas Cantilupe, and S. Xaverius? The like is of deſperate Diſeaſes cured by the Prayers of Saints in God's Church? Hereof we have great Evidence taken <hi>from Ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvitneſſes,</hi> and the undoubted Teſtimony of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe who have left them upon Record. Mr Dr certainly requires not, when à Miracle is done, That God tell us by <hi>à nevv Revelation</hi> it is à work <hi>above all natural Povver,</hi> or that he work <hi>one</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to confirm the Truth of <hi>another,</hi> This would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply à <hi>Proceſſe in Infinitum,</hi> when one may as well Queſtion <hi>the ſecond, or third Miracle, as the first.</hi> Neither, were our Saviours Miracles when do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, proved after this manner. No. They were firſt ſeen by credible Witneſſes, afterwards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged, And that was proof enough. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing Queſtionable is, whether if ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles (as are now evinced) were viſibly exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, may notwithſtanding (that exteriour Evidence) be held deceiptful Appearances only, or wrought by à Power leſſe than Divine? This the Dr hints at, and would fain have all
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:96808:173"/> our Miracles thought at moſt <hi>bare Appearances,</hi> if yet ſo much.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I Say in à word; <hi>VVhat even Reaſon proves Chriſt and his Apoſtles to have vvrought true Miracles by Divine Povver, evinces the Very ſame of all appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Miracles</hi> done in the Church. God therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re was and is, the ſole Principal cauſe of all ſuch Miraculous Effects.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Before I prove what is here aſſerted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect<note place="margin">Irenaeus l. 2 c. 57. ſine.</note> upon the Reſuſcitation <hi>of Lazarus</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved afterwards à long time; Call alſo to mind thoſe mentioned by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that were raiſed from death, and perſeverantly lived (ſaith this great Author) <hi>multis annis, many years vvith us.</hi> So alſo no few did, reſuſcitated by S. Thomas Cantilupe, S. Dominick, and S. Xaverius.

                  <hi>live not.</hi> Now for ſtrange Cures, conſider in the next place, that man lame from his Mothers womb, who lay begging at the Gate of the Temple called <hi>Beautiful,</hi> to whom S. Peter, ſaith<note place="margin">The dead raiſed to life and deſpera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te Diſcaſes cured.</note> Holy Scripture, inſtantly gave <hi>health, ſtrength, and vigour.</hi> Compare his cure with that of poor John Clement, born alſo à Criple from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb that often ſate begging at the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te <hi>of our Ladies Church</hi> in Montagu, And in à moment of time (like the other in the Acts) lifted himſelfe up, ſtood ſtraight on his feet, and was Miraculouſly cured by the Interceſſion of the ever Bleſſed Virgin.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence I Argue. Chriſt is rationally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have raiſed Lazarus to life <hi>by Divine Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> if no Power in nature or Divels could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that ſtrange Effect. <hi>Ergo</hi> thoſe other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſcitations
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:96808:174"/> now mentioned, are as rationally proved wrought by Divine Virtue, if no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in nature nor Divels could produce them. Again. That cure wrought upon the Lame born<note place="margin">All done by Divine Power.</note> Criple Sitting at the Temple gate, is rationally proved Miraculous, and done by Divine Virtue if no Power in nature or Divels did it. <hi>Ergo</hi> that cure wrought upon John Clement, no leſſe à lame born Criple, is as rationally proved Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, and done by Divine Virtue, if no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in nature or Divels did it; <hi>But the Antecedents</hi> here propoſed in <hi>both caſes are moſt true, Therefore neceſſarily infer Truth in their Conſequences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. I am firſt to Show that no Power in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Divels can raiſe the Dead to life, and will not entertain the Reader with the open Folly of ſome <hi>Arabians,</hi> who thought Chriſt wrought all his Miracles, and conſequently raiſed the Dead, by the ſtrength of his <hi>Povverful Imagination.</hi> As wholly ſtupid are thoſe Judiciary Aſtrologers that aſcribe them to the different <hi>Aſpects</hi> or <hi>Situations of Stars,</hi> in which knowledge (ſay they) Chriſt was moſt converſant. <hi>Michael de Medina</hi> both<note place="margin">Medina de rectâ in Deum fide lib. 2. c. 7.</note> largely and learnedly refutes theſe whymſies and showes, that Imagination, can indeed, work ſtrange Effects in the Body and mind of ſuch as are liable to <hi>violent fancies,</hi> (whereof he gives prodigious Examples) but can effect nothing<note place="margin">Se his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge 69. B.</note> upon Things diſtant, or wholly ſeparated from the <hi>Imaginative Faculty.</hi> If therefore one ſit's Lame in à chair, and ſee's à Book à farr off in à Stationers Shop, the ſtrongeſt Imagination in the world will never bring that Book into his hands. He refutes alſo the Aſtrologers upon this ground, that not only our Saviour, but the bleſſed Apoſtles alſo diſperſed the whole world
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:96808:174"/> over under <hi>different conſtellations,</hi> (yea their very<note place="margin">The fooleries of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> girdles, handherchiefs, and Garments, and the Saints in Heaven when invoked at their Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, work innumerable Miracles, independently of the various motions, and Aſpects of Stars. Finally ſaith Medina, if à ſtrong Imagination, or Stars can produce ſuch admirable Effects, how comes it to paſſe, that theſe talkative men were all born under <hi>ſo unluckly Planets,</hi> as to doe none? How happen's it, they are ſo feeble in their Apprehenſions, that not one among them could ever yet work à true Miracle? But enough of Fooleries.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Some thought more wiſe tell us, that all our Saviours Miracles (the like is of thoſe wrought in the Church) may bee eaſily effected by à <hi>Secret art of Magick,</hi> earneſtly ſought after by many. Briefly; All Magick is either natural or Ceremonial, when done by evil Spirits it is called <hi>Necromancy.</hi> The firſt Magick makes à Search into the hidden Things of Nature, and by à ready application of active Agents to Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive often showes ſtrange Effects, <hi>yet no vvayes Miraculous.</hi> For the attaining of this knowledge, <hi>Empedocles, Democritus, Apollonius, and Anaxago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> travelled far, and viewed à great part of the Univerſe. Some by virtue of it produce Roſes and ripe Grapes in Winter, others by Alchimy have long tried to find out the Philoſophers Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, but with what ſucceſſe, I know not. Now this Magick (add to it that they call <hi>Aſtronomical,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Effects wrought by natural Magick.</note> and <hi>Cabaliſtical</hi>) being only limited to natural Cauſes, can do nothing that's above all natural Power, as moſt certainly the raiſing of the dead is. Neither did thoſe who ſo highly extol this Art, ever yet pretend to call men out of their
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:96808:175"/> Graves, and endue them with the like Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of life, they had before.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Necromancy whether <hi>Goetick,</hi> or <hi>Theur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> practized by Divels and Witches has its<note place="margin">Necromancy has its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.</note> limits alſo, and extend's no further than only to what is previouſly contained in natural Cauſes, as S. Auguſtin cited above notes excellently well. Now becauſe Angels and Divels know more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately all natural Secrets than mortals do, They can (when God permits) show ſtrange Effects, and very real ones alſo. I ſay <hi>Real.</hi> For all are not (though ſome be) meer Illuſions of the eyes or Phanſy, as <hi>Delrio</hi> and <hi>Michael Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina</hi> Largely prove, and ſolve the contrary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.<note place="margin">Delrio Diſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gniſ. magic. lib. 2. quaeſt, 16.

               <p n="9">9. <hi>Delrio</hi> showes, that Witches are really tranſported by Divels to remote places, where many meet together, ſport and banquet. For Proof hereof he relates two ſtrange Stories, the one borrowed from <hi>Gulielmus Neubrigenſis,</hi> is of à<note place="margin">Neubrig. l. 1 rerum Angl. c. 38.</note> Countryman who paſſing one night by à Grot heard Singing and merriment, looking in he ſaw à large room all enlightned with à great number of men and women feaſting together.

The Cup, ſaith <hi>Neubrigenſis,</hi> made of à ſtrange unknown matter, of à fashion alſo no leſs odd and unuſual, was preſented as à Gift to Henry the Elder, King of
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:96808:175"/> England, and afterwards given to the King of Scots.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The other Story Written by <hi>Robertus Triezius</hi> one of <hi>Liſle,</hi> Delrio recount's, and sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes<note place="margin">Delrio queſt. 6.</note> à pritty ſtrife between two Conjurers. The one had laid hold of à young woman, (placed on à wooden horſe behind him) and carried her through the Air by à Caſtle in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> where, as it happened, another Magician was with many more at à banquet. That ſtrange ſight diſcovered of à couple ſo well mounted ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding through the Air; The Conjurer in the Caſtle <hi>began his Charms,</hi> and forced man, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and horſe down into à Plain before the Caſtle, where they remained immoveable. The Conjurer with his woman thus fixed, perceiving that the other in the Caſtle had thruſt his head and neck out of à window between two barrs of Iron, to revenge himſelfe, preſently clap't à great pair of branched horns upon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. He could not draw his head back, the horns hindred, forward he durſt not venture, the Precipice being fearful. Finally an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made. The horned Magician diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the other with his woman, and the Brother Conjurer on the Plain in requital<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> took off the Magicians horns within the Caſtle. If theſe Stories be true (Written as very certain) it ſeem's clear, that all things told of Magicians are not meer Illuſions, <hi>or fancies only.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Some willing to oppoſe this Doctrin, urge that Feat of the Aegiptian Magicians, whoſe Rods caſt down like that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> were turned into Serpents, And this done by Necromancy, was à work of the Divel, and no illuſive but à true real Converſion, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the words of Scripture, <hi>Similiter ac</hi>

                  <hi>Moſes,</hi> They did as Moſes had done. So S. Auguſtine and many Fathers Judge Quoted by Delrio, whence it followes, that the Divel can give being to Subſtantial Form's. I Anſwer, he can help to ſuch productions <hi>of imperfect A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,</hi> uſually called <hi>Inſecta,</hi> in caſe he more quickly introduce into à Putrified rod apt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions for à frog, or Serpent, which Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan thinke was here done, <hi>But this reaches not to the Immediate Production of either ſubſtantial or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Form.</hi> Others ſay. That the Divel by à ſlight Legerdemain, ſecretly conveyed into the place of the Magicians Rods, true Serpents, and ſo ſolve the difficulty. Be it how you will, Moſes his rod changed into à Serpent, devovred that of the Enchanters, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was evidently the greater Miracle.</p>
               <p n="13">13. By all hitherto noted our Aſſertion
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:96808:176" rendition="simple:additions"/> above (Viz. That neither Divel nor Magician can raiſe the dead to life), ſeems more and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re confirmed, which appear's à greater work than to produce <hi>any natural ſubſtance.</hi> A further reaſon hereof, convinces. The Soul ſeparated from the Body is either held <hi>mortal,</hi> or <hi>immortal;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Why Divels cannot raiſe the dead?</note> If mortal, it perishes, and cannot return again but by creation, But no Divel <hi>can Create</hi> or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſomething out of nothing, This being the work of God only Omnipotent; <hi>If immortal;</hi> it is caſt out of this Univerſe, and conſequently nothing in the order of nature has Power to act upon it, or to reduce it to the Body, which it firſt informed. Whence Franciſcus Victoria no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes<note place="margin">Victoria Tom. 2. de arte Magica page 279.</note> excellently well, That theſe Divels are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed about leſſer matters, in finding out Thieves, or Robbers, who have deprived men of their goods. Much more they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But what shall we ſay to the <hi>VVitch</hi> of<note place="margin">1. Reg. 28. v. 19.</note> Endor by whoſe Charms <hi>Samuel</hi> long before dead, appeared, and told King Saul of the ill Succeſs of his war, as alſo of his death the next<note place="margin">What to the with at En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor?</note> day. Some Anſwer, Samuel did not appear, but think another ſpirit <hi>aſsumed his shape,</hi> and ſpake to Saul. This opinion ſeem's contrary to what we read in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> where Samuel is<note place="margin">Eccl. 46. 23.</note> ſaid after his ſleep or death, to have <hi>notified to the King the End of his life, and exalted his voice out of the earth in Propheſie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> It is alſo contrary to the Doctrin of S. Auſtin expreſly teaching, that Souls<note place="margin">S. Aug. de curâ pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mortuis gerend.</note> departed this life often show themſelves to the living, and he takes one proof from this <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Samuel.</hi> And who can doubt but that <hi>Moſes</hi> being dead, appeared with our Saviour in<note place="margin">Samuel tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared.</note> his glorious Transfiguration? Samuel's ſoul the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:96808:177"/> called out of <hi>Lymbo,</hi> truly appeared, but not by the Charms of that <hi>Pythonical</hi> woman, for the Apparition prevented her Enchantments, and was ſooner than she expected, whence like one amazed, she cryed out at the Sight of Samuel, and asked why <hi>Saul</hi> had deceived her?</p>
               <p n="15">15. Thus it is plain, that no other but God called up Samuel, who by Divine illumination Prophecyed ſo exactly of that wicked King's End, and the death of his Sons, <hi>which Divels na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally could not foretel.</hi> In like manner we read in Scripture, that when King <hi>Ochozias</hi> lying<note place="margin">4. Reg. 1. v. 2. 3.</note> ſick, ſent Meſſengers to queſtion Beelzebub the God of Accaron, and enquired whether he was to dye or no, Almighty God to prevent the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, commanded <hi>Elias</hi> to tell the King, he should not riſe from his bed, but dye; And thus in raiſing Samuel the true Meſſenger, he prevented the <hi>Pythoniſſa's</hi> Enchantment, if yet she uſed any, whereof Scripture gives no light at all. My Aſſertion therefore remain's Firm that Divels cannot raiſe the dead.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Neither can they cure any deſperate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, though in leſſer matters much may be<note place="margin">Deſperate diſeaſes not Curable by Divels.</note> done by <hi>natural remedies,</hi> but to reſtore Sight to one borne blinde, to take à Leg or Arm cut off, and joyn it again to à maimed Body, are cures above the power of Divels, and were never yet wrought by <hi>Necromancie.</hi> Again, when circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancies plainly show, that all cures wrought by Chriſt and in the Church were done by Divine Virtue, it's madneſs to make the Divel Author of them.

                  <note place="margin">John 9.</note> had the Divel think ye any hand here? Others implore help from the bleſſed Saints in Heaven, and

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:96808:179"/> of him they were done for, whether affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted or diſeaſed, And this our Saviour fixed upon, when he cured the blindeman, ſo alſo S. Peter did in the Cure he wrought upon the Lame Criple ſitting at the Temple gate. The other End, ever intended by Almighty God (though not alwaies explicitly declared) was the manifeſtation of his Divine Power (<hi>ut manifeſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 9. 3.</note>

                  <hi>thou art come from God, For no man can do the Signs thou does't, unleſſe God be vvith him.</hi> But if Chriſt and the Apoſtles were rationally proved Teachers ſent from God by Miracles, their Doctrin was in like manner rationally evinced <hi>ſound,</hi> and <hi>infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2.

So ſay I, Ask what Miracles ſpeak of the Church? They have their language, and tell us, <hi>She is à luminous Sun, that diſperſes her ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes over the vvhole Vniverſe, She is Gods ovvn Oracle,</hi> and therefore what Doctrin She teaches is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

                  <hi>by reaſon</hi> evidently Credible, ſound and true.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Again many Saints have often publickly declared, that the Miracles they wrought we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re done to confirm the Catholick Faith. So ſpeak's S.

               <p n="13">13. To clear what is now ſaid, Let us Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin that Dr Still, or ſome ſuch like Incredulous man had been preſent with our Saviour when he cured the blind, or cleanſed the Lepers: He would upon <hi>Moral certainty</hi> have Judged the <hi>vvorks Miraculous,</hi> But withall might have doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt did them by Divine Power, or no, (hereof he had no Evidence at all). Suppoſe, that ſome other known Oracle owned infallible, had told him, <hi>Theſe ſtrange Cures thou ſees't</hi> proceed from God, He would without heſitancy have
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:96808:192"/> yeilded à firm Aſſent to their certain Truth, and Judged them Miracles proceeding from God. Thus we diſcourſe of Miracles wrought in the Church. A knowledge highly moral grounded on <hi>humane Faith,</hi> firſt Propoſes them as Works done by Almighty God, though as yet not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly certain, But when we hear that our <hi>Oracle</hi> approves them, under the Notion of works done by Divine Power, all further doubt ceaſes, all heſitancy is taken away.</p>
               <p n="14">14. From what we have ſaid hitherto, Two<note place="margin">Two things deduced from the former Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe:</note> things follow. The firſt is, that our Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles (as ſeen or heard of) are eaſily diſtinguis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed upon <hi>Moral certainty</hi> from all Jugling Leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demain Wonders, pretended by Heathens and Hereticks. Their exteriour Luſtre <hi>even to Senſe,</hi> Their long and never interrupted Continuance in any Age, <hi>Their prodigious Greatneſs and vaſt number vvrought in à</hi> Holy Society of Chriſtians, and by men of à moſt innocent life, manifeſtly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence them, from thoſe other few and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Wonders laid claim to by Gods profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Enemies. Add to this exteriour viſible Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, the Churches Judgement and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation (<hi>Though only Humane</hi>) relating to the real Truth of Miracles, all compariſon ceaſes, the Difference between true and falſe Signs is made moſt notorious.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The ſecond thing obſervable is, That all Arguments Imaginable, which either are or can be propoſed againſt Miracles wrought in the Church, have the very ſame force againſt our Saviours, and the Apoſtles Signs. That they are now regiſtred in Scripture, and thereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de <hi>matters of Faith</hi> weakens nothing the Strength of my Argument, For I conſider thoſe Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:96808:193"/> Miracles <hi>as famed</hi> up and down the world, and <hi>known upon humane Faith</hi> before the Holy Ghoſt ſealed them up in the Book of Scripture. Thus conſidered, the Proofs are the ſame for Miracles wrought by Chriſt and in the Church. And we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re there any Argument (as there is none) that could leſſen the Credit of latter Miracles, it would as I ſaid, be as forcible againſt the moſt Primitive Wonders. Our Saviour, all know, wrought many Miracles not recorded in Holy Writ, and ſo alſo the Apoſtles did. Suppoſe, theſe had been conveyed to us upon the Teſtimony of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve Authors (<hi>as the very moſt of the Apoſtles Miracles are</hi>) muſt ſuch works of God <hi>be exploded as Fourbs,</hi> becauſe not recorded in Scripture?

And I<note place="margin">Neither Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetan any ever taught that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the Dead.</note> am ſure neither Cajetan nor any Chriſtian ever thought, that the Divel called thoſe Dead to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, or did thoſe great Cures which our Saviour and the Apoſtles wrought.

No diſparity can be given, Suppoſing the <hi>matters of Fact true,</hi> And to call the Truth of all approved Miracles into doubt reaches to á high Degree of Madneſs.</p>
               <p n="18">18.

One certainty called <hi>Metaphyſical,</hi> is altogether Infallible.

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:96808:201"/> A third certainty called <hi>Moral,</hi> (though inferiour to the other two) may be ſo perſwaſive, That none but moſt impudently and rashly, can call the matter atteſted into doubt. This Degree of <hi>Moral certainty</hi> all thoſe had, who upon the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Information of faithful Witneſſes, heard that our Lord reſtored life to Lazarus, though they ſaw not the Miracle. Thus much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
               <p n="19">19. I Say it is not neceſſary that Miracles which induce to Faith, or excite us to believe, be known <hi>by Metaphyſical or Phyſical certainty.</hi> A high <hi>moral Aſſurance</hi> of their being wrought (The very moſt of the Primitive Chriſtians before they believed, had no greater) is abundantly enough, and fully ſufficient. The reaſon is Miracles as<note place="margin">cap. 14. num. 8. 9.</note> I noted above, show not Faith to be <hi>evidently true,</hi> but only <hi>evidently credible,</hi> neither are they the formal Object whereon Faith relies, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Inducements only, moving to accept of what ever Truth God Reveal's.

Again, when the Church approves Miracles as true, <hi>we aſcend</hi> to à higher Step of certainty, and own them (thus approved) without all heſitancy indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe à known Oracle ſeal's them up <hi>as certain.</hi> Now I Ask Mr D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> (who playes at <hi>fast</hi>

               <p n="1">1. THus Reader, by Gods good Aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce we are as you ſee come to an End of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stillingfleets Enquiry into Miracles. A Treatiſe far more faſtidious and tireing, than hard and difficult, for you have not in the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le Book one rational Argument, one Teſtimony of any Orthodox Church, one clear Sentence of à Father, or ſo much as any one Authority of Divines produced, againſt the approved Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought in the Roman Catholick Church. This I Averr, and do it with ſo great Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that I challenge M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> to rejoyn if he can, and Diſprove what I ſay. Yet after all you muſt hear the poor man brag, as if he had do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Wonders, <hi>in taking, forſooth, more pains,</hi>

                  </note> Philoſtorgius (witnes Photius) did <hi>S. Baſil's,</hi> whom he made more renowned by his Senceleſs railing at the Saint. Your weak Efforts, Mr D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, your Calumnies, your Taunts, your Jeers, your open Falſities, wherewith you man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtrive to obſcure God's own <hi>Seals and Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> are ſo far from Eclipſing their Luſtre, that Miracles thereby are made more glorious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Reader, had this D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> gone about to Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de from à Beliefe of the Sacred Trinity, or the Incarnation, becauſe the Myſteries are very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and ſurpaſſe our short Capacities, he might, perhaps, have had followers, and gained ſome to his Opinion, But to vapour only as he doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt<note place="margin">A bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſet againſt plain Objects of Senſe, ſeen by thouſands</note> 
                  <hi>plain matters of Fact, viſible Objects of ſenſe,</hi> ſeen by innumerable ſworn Ey-witneſſes, and by that means to hope for Proſelyts, or to draw one of ordinary Prudence to his Sentiment, is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate an attempt, ſo profound à folly, That the like could have never entred any man's head but D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stillingfleet's.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What therefore moved the Dr to Write his <hi>Enquiry,</hi> or for what End came it forth? Was the great pains he ſpeak's of taken, to Diſcredit forged or meer pretended Miracles? A needleſſe<note place="margin">It is hard to ſay, what moved the Dr to write this Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iy.</note> entertainment ſeing the Church long ſince, had laid à heavy Cenſure upon all that Doe ſo. Did he (conſcious of his fraudulent Proceeding) think his Book would take with à ſimple ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that want leaſure, and Abilities to trace him
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:96808:205"/> through his many Meanders? Or could he perſwade himſelfe, if ſuch poor Souls were enſnared, or impoſed upon, he had done an Heroick work? If ſo; He is unworthy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Converſation, and can hope for nothing, but à large allowance of Diſgrace before God</p>
               <p n="4">4. It may be replyed. The D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> verily thought his <hi>Enquiry</hi> would gain eſteem among the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and be valued of as à ſingular rare Piece. Speak ſo. He Diſcovers à mighty want of Judgement, For how could this man, who<note place="margin">No applauſe to bee hoped, from the Learned.</note> never yet through his whole Book, was able to caſt the leaſt blemish upon one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Miracle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, brag of his pains? How could he think that the learned would applaud his Labours, or ſo much as take notice of ſo empty and fruitleſſe á work? Now that he has not made the leaſt rational Exception againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne approved Miracle, is as clear, as that there are letters in his Book. If he Say I wrong him, He may right himſelfe, and show me, <hi>vvhere,</hi> in <hi>vvhat Page, or Paragraph</hi> through his whole Treatiſe, he has made it out, that ſuch and ſuch <hi>opproved Miracles</hi> (Nay, I ſay One) have been by him plainly dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, <hi>falſe, feigned,</hi> and <hi>counterfeit.</hi> 'Tis true in rambling up and down, he bring's to light ſome forged Miracles, which the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt's, and ſeverely punishes, But thoſe no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re obſcure the Luſtre of true Miracles, than one mans horrid crime, caſt's à blemish on another known moſt juſt, and honeſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Perhaps this or the like Fancy moſt<note place="margin">How the Dr might Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</note> ſwayed with the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, and ſet his fingers on Itch to write againſt Miracles. Many Miracles (might he ſay) for time and place are remote
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:96808:205"/> from us, and therefore the very moſt of our English Nation (as things now ſtand) being <hi>ſtrangely incredulous,</hi> cannot but look upon them as matters of Fact no way clear, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe very dark and doubtful. It will The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore be eaſy for me after ſome diſcovery of forged Miracles (Thoſe muſt usher in the main Deſigne) to blaſt the credit of <hi>the Very beſt Miracles,</hi> and, though I cannot lay the leaſt Aſperſion upon one approved by their Church, yet when I handle ſuch à Subject at diſtance from men shut up in an Iſland, and ſpeak to an obdurate ſort of People who ſcarcely believe their Creed, I may well hope my pains will have the Succeſſe I wish, which is to disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the nobleſt Motive for Chriſtian Faith, <hi>The glory of Miracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. In caſe theſe or the like thoughts ſet the Dr<note place="margin">Things once really done ceaſe not to be true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te from us.</note> on work (and I cannot, Imagin upon what other Deſign he wrote) I Anſwer. Though he might ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke great advantage from the Incredulity of many thouſands diſperſed over England, and may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in time perſwade the very moſt <hi>of ſuch men</hi> to believe nothing at all, Yet none, I hope, are ſo deeply beſotted, as to think that á matter once really done, leaves off to be true, becauſe it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from us, for upon this account our Saviours Miracles may be Cavilled at.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But to give the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Satisfaction in every thing propoſable, shall we wave at preſent thoſe more ancient Miracles recounted by <hi>S. Irenaeus; S. Auſtin, and others,</hi> and require the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Anſwer to ſome latter, three or four on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought in the memory of many yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, will be ſufficient. John Clements Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Cure at <hi>Montaigu,</hi> is one, whereof
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:96808:206"/> the Dr never yet took notice. The poor youths reſtored Leg in Spain shall be another. A Third is, that ſudden and Miraculous cure done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on F. Maſtrilli in Naples by the glorious S. Xaverius. The laſt (becauſe the moſt neer <hi>Anno</hi> 1661.) is that undoubted Miracle, which God manifeſted at <hi>Calais</hi> upon à young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, by the Interceſſion of Bleſſed <hi>S.

                  <note place="margin">Se C. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>of Paula.</hi> Theſe Miracles (excepting the laſt related in this Treatiſe) are, as is largely proved <hi>Reaſon and Religion,</hi> owned by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian<note place="margin">Reaſ. and Relig. Diſc. 2 c. 8. n. 17. 18. and cap. 9. n. 11</note> world moſt certain, I therefore require Dr Stillingfleet's plain and expreſs Anſwer to every one, being yet fresh in the minds and Eyes of innumerable. Unleſſe full Satisfaction be given herein, I would have the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> know, that though he write Volumes againſt this short Treatiſe, all he doth, or can do (after this juſt Provocation)<note place="margin">what ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from the Dr?</note> will appear weightleſſe, inſignificant, dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to à Doctor, in fine worth little but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Moreover, Let not the Gentleman think, that to ſcorn God's moſt certain Wonders will doe his work, or prove Satisfactory to me. Let him not think, though in Spight of Truth he call's that ſtupendious Miracle wrought in Spain, <hi>A pretended growing out of à Leg,</hi> and to his shame tell's us, <hi>It is an eaſy thing for à Stump to grow à Leg in its paſsing from Spain hither,</hi> which is to ſay in other terms, 'Tis à Lye, à fourb, both falſely ſet<note place="margin">Ieers shall no longer ſerve the Dr's turne.</note> abroad, and foolishly believed. I Say, let him not think, that ſuch <hi>Fatras</hi> will ſerve his turn. No. We expect better Anſwers (old birds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, are not eaſily caught with chaffe), He muſt therefore either prove Fraud in this, and the other Miracles hinted at, or will be forced by reaſon
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:96808:206"/> and Authority to own the <hi>Facts</hi> moſt true, and unqueſtionable.</p>
               <p n="9">9. One word briefly concerning the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">No want of Clarity for either an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Miracles.</note> want of Clarity for our Miracles, whether ancient or of à latter date. My Aſſertion is. It is as clear and manifeſt (yea much more manifeſt at this day I write theſe Lines) that innumerable moſt certain Miracles have been wrought in the Roman Catholick Church, than it will be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt one Age hence, that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Still. was ever à <hi>man in being,</hi> à ſtudent in Cambridge, received De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in that Univerſity, or finally was promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to à Rectorship of S. Andrewes. For proof of my Aſſertion I ſuppoſe, few or none now living will be alive à hundred years hence. How will it then be proved, if any doubt be, that<note place="margin">The Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proved by one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</note> the Dr was ever in Being? You will Anſwer moſt eaſily, from the Regiſter of his Baptiſm. Very good. But we have moſt evidently as clear Regiſters for innumerable Miracles, <hi>The time when, the place vvhere,</hi> the Circumſtances how they were wrought, <hi>the Ey-vvitneſſes that ſavv</hi> them, their Examination, and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are with all clarity regiſtred. Thus our Proofs are equal. Again, Records may tell, when and at what time from à Bachelour of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity He became D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, and as faithful Records informe us, when, and in what time, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom, innumerable Miracles have been wrought. A conſtant Fame, or report of the Dr's Promotion to S. Andrews may, its likely, be preſerved in the minds of Some above an Age. And have we not as conſtant, yea à far more univerſal Fame, for the four Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles now mentioned, and many others? The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is no compariſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

If therefore it would be plain Dotage in any to doubt of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Still. birth and Promotions, when the particulars are proved upon the moral Certainty already ſet down (it will be no greater but Moral à hundred years hence) much more is it à Degree of madneſs to call à hundred Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles into doubt, whereof we have at leaſt ſo high Moral Certainty, And as I now ſaid, far mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Univerſal.</p>

An ungrounded Diſcourſe, if ever any was. For though à Miracle in it ſelfe be à Work of God above all natural Power, yet to<note place="margin">To work à Miracle is above all power in Nature, but to ſe it when done is not Miraculous.</note> ſee it when <hi>it's done,</hi> is no <hi>way Miraculous,</hi> but moſt connatural. Had Lazarus his Siſters. when they ſaw their Brother called out of his Grave their eyes Miraculouſly opened to behold and converſe with him? Should God now crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te à man never yet in this world, and impower him to Preach in the City of London, His Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be Miraculous, but to hear him Preach to treat and converſe with him, would imply no Miracle. Now that many Miracles have been ſeen and atteſted upon ſolemn Oath is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proved. Again, if the Argument propoſed
